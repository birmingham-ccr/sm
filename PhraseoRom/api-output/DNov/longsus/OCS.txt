said the old man, patting her on the head
said he as he placed a chair near the fire
said the old man in a shrill voice
cried the old man interrupting me
he laid his hand upon my arm and leant forward to whisper
he cried with sudden querulousness
said the old man turning to me with a sigh, as if I had spoken to him but that moment
returned the old man thoughtfully
replied the child with great earnestness
said the old men, patting the child's cheek
he returned, looking anxiously in my face
he said in a low voice
the child had said in answer to my question
said he, pointing to the man whom I had found in company with him
returned the other, after bestowing a stare and a frown on me
cried the old man, passionately clasping his hands and looking upward
he added, in a lower voice as he drew closer to me
said the young fellow catching at the word
said Mr Swiveller with a sigh
cried Mr Swiveller, tapping his nose
said Mr Swiveller stopping short, as if the idea had suddenly occurred to him, and speaking in the same audible whisper as before
returned the other, looking coldly at him
said the old man with sparkling eyes
said the old man dropping his voice and speaking like one who thinks aloud
said the dwarf, who with his hand stretched out above his eyes had been surveying the young man attentively
the child repeated with great emotion
said the dwarf with a sour look and a shrug of his shoulders
he added, turning to the old man
he said, putting his hand into his breast and sidling up to the old man as he spoke
echoed the dwarf, approaching close to his ear
Mrs Quilp had been a Miss Jiniwin it should be observed
said Mrs Quilp, nodding her head
said the old lady with a giggle, meant for satirical and to imply that he needed to be reminded of the fact
said the dwarf, turing round and addressing his wife
he said looking round with a malicious grin
said Quilp, wilfully misunderstanding her, of course
he said after a short effort of attention
said the boy, nodding his head and drawing back, with the elbows ready in case of the worst
said Quilp, passing into the wooden counting-house
said Quilp, wrinkling up his eyes and luring her towards him with his bent forefinger
cried Nelly, clasping her hand
cried Quilp, diving into the little counting-house and returning with a thick stick
said his boy, dodging round him and watching an opportunity to rush in
said Quilp, with gleaming eyes
said the boy, nodding his head and rubbing it at the same time
replied to boy, pointing to Kit
whispered Quilp, nipping and pinching her arm
returned the child, kissing her cheek
said the child with streaming eyes
said his friend, stirring the mixture
said Dick with great emphasis
said the other, returning to his seat after having paced the room twice or thrice
repeated the other with a steadiness of manner, of the effect of which upon his companion he was well assured by long experience
said Dick shaking his head
returned the other with an increased earnestness, which, whether it were real or assumed, had the same effect on his companion
said Mr Swiveller, taking a long pull at
said Dick, sticking his fork into a large carbuncular potato
said Dick shaking his head with a look of infinite wisdom, and running on (as he was accustomed to do) with scraps of verse as if they were only prose in a hurry
said Mrs Wackles to her eldest daughter
If he really cares about me,' thought Miss Sophy
said Miss Cheggs approaching once more
said Dick, rather oblivious of the purpose with which he had really come
said Richard Swiviller to himself when he had reached home and was hanging over the candle with the extinguisher in his hand
cried the girl with an energy which shone in her flushed face, trembling voice, and impassioned gesture
said the child passing an arm round his neck
said the dwarf, smacking his lips
said Quilp, nursing his short leg, and making his eyes twinkle very much
said Quilp, speaking very slowly, and feigning to be quite absorbed in the subject
continued the dwarf dismounting from the chair and sitting down in it, with a careful slowness of gesture very different from the rapidity with which he had sprung up unheard
said the old man, clenching his hands desperately, and looking upwards
said Quilp glancing sternly at him, and beating his hand twice or thrice upon the table to attract his wandering attention
cried the old man, turning upon him with gleaming eyes
said Quilp looking contemptuously at him
cried the old man, suddenly rousing himself from his state of despondency, and lashed into the most violent excitement
said the old man, drawing some scraps of paper from his pocket with a trembling hand, and clasping the dwarf's arm
the old man cried, trembling so much the while, that the papers in his hand fluttered as if they were shaken by the wind
said Quilp, looking at his watch with perfect self-possession
gasped the old man, catching at his skirts
said Quilp with unusual politeness
retorted the old man desperately
cried a woman turning sharply round
said Kit, taking out his clasp-knife, and falling upon a great piece of bread and meat which she had had ready for him, hours before
said Mrs Nubbles, evading the point
replied her son, taking up the porter pot
cried his mother, stopping in her work and looking round
replied Kit, with something like a blush on his uncouth face
said his mother, taking up the theme afresh, after a time
said Kit, standing up to listen
returned the child with tearful eyes
said the child, looking to the woman and laying it on the table
said Quilp, turning to the boy
said the dwarf, in what he meant to be a soothing tone
muttered Brass, as if in confidence between himself and the ceiling
replied the child, hurrying away, with the few articles of dress she had come to remove
replied the child, doubtful whether she ought to hold any communication with the supposed culprit, but inclining to her old favourite still
cried the boy coming under the window, and speaking in a lower tone
said the old man feebly
said the dwarf, raising his voice, for the old man's senses were duller than they had been
pursued Quilp after a short pause
bawled the dwarf nodding his head
said the dwarf, looking viciously about him
said Mr Swiveller, by turns advancing and retreating in a threatening attitude
said Quilp, rubbing his shoulders
said the dwarf, getting up with a short groan
muttered the dwarf, darting an angry look at his wife
said the dwarf when they had entered the shop
said Mr Brass, clapping his hands once, with an emphasis
he said, glancing at Swiveller
said Dick, looking at the confusion about him
added the dwarf, rubbing his hands hard
said Dick, with a blank look
said Dick, producing a very small limp card
said Dick, substituting another in its stead
said the old gentleman, gravely
observed a small quiet voice
said the old cottager in a thin piping voice
cried the old man, making signs to Nell to listen
she said, taking her into the bar
said Mr Codlin, who talked very slowly and ate very greedily, as is not uncommon with philosophers and misanthropes
cried Mr Thomas Codlin, presenting his head and face in the proscenium of the stage, and exhibiting an expression of countenance not often seen there
said Mr Codlin, beating his hand on the little footboard where Punch, when suddenly struck with the symmetry of his legs and their capacity for silk stockings, is accustomed to exhibit them to popular admiration
rejoined the landlord, glancing at the sky
said the landlord smacking his lips
smacking them for the fourth time
said the landlord looking up to the clock -- and the very clock had a colour in its fat white face, and looked a clock for jolly Sandboys to consult
growled Mr Codlin, glancing at the clock
growled Mr Codlin, again glancing at the clock and from it to the cauldron
repeated Short emphatically and slowly
said Mr Codlin, who with his head upon his hands, and his elbows on his knees, had been shaking himself impatiently from side to side up to this point and occasionally stamping on the ground, but who now looked up with eager eyes
said Jerry, putting his hand into the capacious pocket of his coat, and diving into one corner as if he were feeling for a small orange or an apple or some such article
said Jerry, pointing out the old leader of the troop, and speaking in a terrible voice
said Mr Vuffin, looking solemnly round
replied Codlin, a little put out as it seemed by the question
cried Kit with a rueful face
said Mr Garland when they had made some further inquiries of him
said she, in reply to this mute interrogation
said the old gentleman and the old lady both together
said Mrs Garland to Kit's mother
said Kit, hurrying back into the house
said Quilp, looking sternly at him
urged Quilp, plucking him by the sleeve and looking slyly up into his face out of the corners of his eyes
said Quilp, as Richard Swiveller smacked his lips
cried Dick, throwing away part of the contents of his glass, and filling it up with water
cried Quilp, rattling on the table in a dexterous manner with his fist and elbow alternately, in a kind of tune
returned Kit, with a serious look
said Mr Swiveller, bewailing his hard lot
said Mr Swiveller raising his voice to a high pitch, and looking sleepily round
said Quilp to him, at parting
added Dick, smiting himself on the breast
said the old man, looking fearfully round
rejoined the schoolmaster shaking his head sorrowfully
he said, in his quiet, patient way
said the old man irresolutely
said the schoolmaster when the clock struck twelve
said the schoolmaster, drawing near her chair
whispered the schoolmaster, anxious to rouse him, for a dulness seemed gathering upon the child
said the schoolmaster, shaking his head, and smiling thoughtfully
repeated the lady of the caravan
said the lady of the caravan
said the lady of the caravan, with an appearance of being more interested in this question than the last
returned the follower, wisely reserving himself for any favourable contingency that might occur
and then another scroll, on which was written
and then several smaller scrolls with such inscriptions as
The genuine and only Jarley
Jarley is the delight of the Nobility and Gentry
I saw thy show in youthful prime
while, to consult all tastes, others were composed with a view to the lighter and more facetious spirits, as a parody on the favourite air of
said the lady, rising into the tone and manner in which she was accustomed to address her audiences
cried Quilp, looking up at the old gateway, and showing in the moonlight like some monstrous image that had come down from its niche and was casting a backward glance at its old house
said the lady of the caravan
said the military gentleman, checking himself and looking round the room
said Mr Slum, taking off his hat which was full of scraps of paper
said Mrs Jarley in her exhibition tone, as Nell touched a figure at the beginning of the platform
said Mr Groves, no answer being returned
said a sharp cracked voice of most disagreeable quality, when a tremendous peal of thunder had died away
said the other, interrupting him
said the stout man, raising his eyes from his cards for the first time
said he, with a cunning look
added Isaac, throwing it into the air and catching it dexterously
rejoined the old man laying his hand upon her mouth
said the old man, patting her cheek
she said in a tremulous voice, after they had walked about a mile in silence
returned the old man, checking himself as some impetuous answer rose to his lips
returned the old man, still without looking at her
said Mrs Jarley when the meal was over
said Miss Monflathers, who was of rather uncertain temper, and lost no opportunity of impressing moral truths upon the tender minds of the young ladies
said Miss Monflathers, putting down her parasol to take a severer view of the offender
both the teachers were astonished
resumed the governess in a tone of increased severity
said Miss Monflathers, turning to Nell
said Mrs Jarley, bursting with the fulness of her anger and the weakness of her means of revenge
upon the door, and the bill
said Miss Sally, smiling drily, for she delighted in nothing so much as irritating her brother
said Quilp, stopping short at the door, and wrinkling up his eyebrows as he looked towards Miss Sally
said Quilp, handing Dick Swiveller forward
said the dwarf, turning briskly to his legal friend
said Brass, like a man abstracted, and looking at the roofs of the opposite houses, with his hands in his pockets
resumed Dick after a thoughtful silence, and telling off the circumstances of his position, one by one, upon his fingers
said Mr Swiveller, taking his leave of the ceiling with a significant nod
said a little voice very low down in the doorway
replied the child with a shrewd look
said Richard Swiveller, taking his pen out of his mouth
were his parting words, as he looked out from between the curtains
Miss Sally pointed with the feather of her pen to Richard
said Brass, laying down his pen
added Brass, in a kind of comfortable, cozy tone
added Brass, still more comfortably and cozily than before
said Brass, darting at him a supercilious and reproachful look
said Dick, gently sliding to the ground
returned Dick, yielding to his destiny and saying whatever came uppermost
he added after a short silence
I have no hesitation in saying, Swiveller, that I entertain a regard for you
said Dick, walking up and down with his hands in his pockets
said Mr Swiveller, checking himself and falling thoughtfully into the client's chair
said Miss Brass, summing up the facts; 'you have had as much as you can eat, you're asked if you want any more, and you answer
said Mr Brass one afternoon
muttered Sampson, filling his pocket with papers
returned their host, in rather a hasty manner
observed Short with an arch look
cried Short, turning with a look of amazement to his friend
said the single gentleman, pacing up and down the room
said Short, turning from his selfish colleague to their new acquaintance
he added, turning again to the Notary and his pupil
said Mr Chuckster, running his fingers through his hair
said Dick, holding up the bright frothy pot
and wasn't Mrs Garland kind when she said
and didn't Kit sign his name bold to his receipt, and didn't Barbara sign her name all a trembling to hers; and wasn't it beautiful to see how Mrs Garland poured out Barbara's mother a glass of wine; and didn't Barbara's mother speak up when she said
just so -- and the gentleman, instead of replying
added the old gentleman with stronger emphasis
added Kit, turning suddenly to his mistress
added Kit, shaking his head sorrowfully
said the old gentleman after reading it
added Mr Garland, glancing at the note in his hand
as incorrectly stated by the same authorities; but
said Mr Chuckster rising in a graceful manner
said the gentleman, turning to him directly he entered the room
said the strange gentleman, turning thoughtfully to the Notary
said Kit, who had listened to this discourse with a lengthening countenance
thought Kit, as he approached the poor dwelling of his mother
thought Kit, gliding into the nearest empty pew which was opposite his mother's, and on the other side of the little aisle
said his mother, with her handkerchief to her eyes
returned Isaac List, who was squatting like a frog on the other side of the fire, and had so screwed himself up that he seemed to be squinting all over
cried the fellow, raising his voice
said his friend, growing more eager, and drawing himself closer to the old man, while he signed to the gipsy not to come between them
said Jowl, lying down again with a careless air
cried Isaac, jumping up and slapping him on the shoulder
said Jowl with feigned reluctance
cried the child within herself
said Jowl, warming his hands at the fire
said the child in a weak voice, as they turned away from this last repulse
said the child, with a momentary firmness that lost itself in tears
cried the old man, clasping his hands and gazing as if for the first time upon her anxious face, her travel-stained dress, and bruised and swollen feet
he added, looking more attentively at the child
said the man, looking still more earnestly at Nell
he said, after a pause
pointing to the doorway from which he had emerged
he said, with a faint smile
he said, shaking his head
she said, as they toiled painfully through the streets
said the gentleman, taking out his snuff-box
said the doctor at length
observed the doctor, who had passed the foot-bath on the stairs
said the doctor, in the voice of an oracle
said the doctor with increased solemnity
said the doctor, rising gravely
rejoined the landlady, with ready good-humour
said the schoolmaster, moving restlessly in his chair
cried the delighted schoolmaster in a low voice
he said, turning to the newly- married couple
He was not going to add
cried Kit's mother, falling back in extreme surprise
said the single gentleman, sternly regarding him
said the unfortunate single gentleman
he continued, after a thoughtful pause
said the dwarf, throwing off a bumper of brandy, and smacking his lips
rejoined Mrs Nubbles, dismounting with her son's assistance
resumed Kit, shouldering the bandbox
said Mr Brass, breaking the silence, and raising his eyes to the ceiling with a sigh
said the lawyer shaking his head
gulping down its contents, and striking himself emphatically a little below the chest
said the lawyer, laying down his pen and emptying his glass
said Mr Brass smiling fondly at the wall
said the dwarf, exulting in his project
replied Mr Swiveller, eating his dinner with great gravity
said the dwarf, pushing past her into the office
added the lawyer, raising his eyes to the ceiling
exclaimed Quilp, with another contemptuous look at Sampson
said the old gentleman, laying his hand upon her head, and smiling sadly
he said, turning to the schoolmaster when the boy was gone
replied the sexton; adding in a half compassionate, half irritable tone, which the old man couldn't hear
returned the old man, shaking his head
thought the child within herself
he pointed to the grave
answered the old man with a shake of the head
said the child, bursting into tears
said the schoolmaster, marking the glance she had thrown around
said the grandfather, looking after him
said the old man, patting her cheek
said the old man, motioning hastily to her with his hand and looking over his shoulder
replied the child, with assumed gaiety
returned the child, with downcast eyes
said the boy, caressing her, and pressing his face to hers
said Mr Swiveller, with a kind of bantering composure
added Richard, taking off his hat again and looking hard at it, as if he were only deterred by pecuniary considerations from spurning it with his foot
returned Mr Chuckster, taking out an oblong snuff-box, the lid whereof was ornamented with a fox's head curiously carved in brass
said Mr Chuckster, shaking his head gravely, as men are wont to do when they consider things are going a little too far
pursued Mr Chuckster with a prophetic look
said Brass, shuffling among his papers
said Brass, taking a letter from his desk
said Mr Brass, in the pleasantest way imaginable
said the lawyer, quitting his stool, and standing before the fire with his back towards it
pursued the lawyer, looking at him in a sort of pensive abstraction
said Sampson, smiling as good men smile when they compassionate their own weakness or that of their fellow- creatures
Mr Brass is patting the pony
says Kit, pleased with the attorney's strong interest in his favourite
cries Brass, smiling, and tapping himself on the bosom
rejoined the small servant; 'Miss Sally
said Dick, handing the purl
said Mr Swiveller, putting two sixpences into a saucer, and trimming the wretched candle, when the cards had been cut and dealt
said the small servant with a shrewd look
added Richard, stopping in his way to the door, and wheeling slowly round upon the small servant, who was following with the candle
said Mr Swiveller, folding his arms
said Mr Swiveller, putting on his nightcap in exactly the same style as he wore his hat
added Richard, getting his left cheek into profile, and looking complacently at the reflection of a very little scrap of whisker in the looking-glass
quoth Miss Brass, abruptly breaking silence
said Miss Brass, pulling out the tin box and refreshing herself with a pinch of snuff
thought Richard, laying down his pen
replied his sister with an air of triumph
repeated Miss Brass, taking another pinch of snuff
said Brass, still fired with an honest indignation, and frowning with knotted brows upon his sister
cried Brass when he had withdrawn
said Brass, slapping all his pockets, one after another, and looking into his desk, and under it, and upon it, and wildly tossing the papers about
replied the lawyer, feeling in all his pockets with looks of the greatest agitation
cried Kit, trembling from head to foot
he demonstrated what kind of examination he meant by turning back the cuffs of his coat
said Brass with a sigh, as he dived into one of Kit's pockets, and fished up a miscellaneous collection of small articles
cried Sampson, clasping his hands
added Mr Brass with greater fortitude
said this subordinate minister of justice
said Sampson, when he returned
cried Sampson, winking and rubbing them
said Sampson, taking off his hat, and kissing the two fore- fingers of his right hand beaver glove
said Brass, stepping between the notary and his private office (towards which he had begun to retreat), and speaking in the tone of an injured man
said the other, in a decided tone
said Brass, laying his right hand on his waistcoat, and looking towards the father and son with a smooth smile
said Mr Witherden, after a long pause
said the constable, looking round
replied Brass, in a very grave manner
cried Kit, on whom a light broke suddenly
say they who have hunted him down
he said, looking round with surprise
sobbed Mrs Nubbles, curtseying humbly
said his mother, whom Barbara's mother had charitably relieved of the baby
said Kit, clutching the bars with an earnestness that shook them
adding in the same breath
murmured the lawyer, standing on tiptoe, and endeavouring to obtain a glimpse of what was passing inside, which at that distance was impossible
cried Brass, shutting the door behind him
said Sampson, looking round as if in appeal to the bruised animal
said the dwarf, looking about him as if for his poker
said Quilp, with his accustomed grin
returned Brass, with intervals of coughing
said Brass, rubbing the place and smiling
said Quilp between his teeth
Kit made him a bow; and when another gentleman in a wig got up and said
Where did I dine yesterday
Oh to be sure -- yes -- just over the way
repeats Mr Brass's gentleman, with a glance at the court
repeats Mr Brass's gentleman in a voice of thunder
Oh yes, to be sure -- yes, I did
Have the goodness to banish a levity, sir, which is very ill-suited to the place in which you stand (though perhaps you have reason to be thankful that it's only that place
Mr Swiveller is proceeding to explain
said Brass, thrusting his hands in his pockets, and rocking himself to and fro on his stool
said Mr Swiveller, turning languidly round on his pillow, and looking on that side of his bed which was next the wall
said Richard after a pause, and smiling with a trembling lip
said the small servant, nodding
said Richard, passing his hand over his forehead and turning suddenly round, as though the subject but that moment flashed upon him
said Mr Swiveller, plucking off his nightcap and flinging it to the other end of the room
said Dick, as she closed the door slowly, and peeped into the room again, to make sure that he was comfortable
said Dick, returning the pressure of Mr Garland's hand
and they, being thus made, as it were, parties to the scene, as regularly answered by another look
said Dick, rousing himself from this pause, and turning round again
said the single gentleman, whom she found alone in the room
said the single gentleman, rising and opening the door of an inner room
said the Notary, taking the word at this crisis
returned Miss Sally, with a sudden flush overspreading her features
said Miss Brass, folding her arms as though she were about to deny something to the death
cried Sally, twitching a pinch of snuff out of her box, as spitefully as if she were in the very act of wrenching off the small servant's nose
said Mr Witherden, pulling out his watch
rejoined Brass with undiminished politeness
cried Brass, seeing that the Notary was about to interrupt him
he said, holding up the green shade, and revealing an eye most horribly discoloured
said Brass, striking the hat fiercely with his clenched hand
pursued Brass, glancing aside at his sister, as though he were talking for her information, and speaking with a snarling malignity, in violent contrast to his usual smoothness
said Brass, picking up his hat again and replacing the shade over his eye, and actually crouching down, in the excess of his servility
said Miss Brass, raising her head, with which she had hitherto sat resting on her hands, and surveying him from head to foot with a bitter sneer
added Brass, allowing himself to be slightly overcome
said Brass, drawing off his glove, and crawling in spirit upon the ground before them
said Brass, looking round with a mournful smile
said Mr Witherden, sitting down at the bedside
said Dick, sobbing and laughing together
she added, as her husband stretched out his hand for it
said the dwarf, addressing himself to her
said the dwarf, seizing her by the arm
he said, with flashing eyes
said Quilp, trying to peer into the gloom by which he was surrounded
said the dwarf, stretching out his arms, and walking slowly on
and goes; and he says in a kind voice
and Barbara's mother tells her that
said the old gentleman rising, and laying his hand on Kit's shoulder
said Barbara -- and it is impossible to tell how carelessly she said it
said Kit, detaining her gently
said Mr Garland, pressing his hand after a pause
answered the old man, in a trembling voice
said the sexton, before Kit could answer
he cried, with a triumphant smile
cried the younger, falling on his knee before him
he added in an altered voice
said the schoolmaster, as he bent down to kiss her on the cheek, and gave his tears free vent
said the old man, stopping at the cottage where his young guide's mother dwelt
