said the pig, in a submissive manner, and not without cheerfulness
he had got to the wall by this time
said he (they all spoke in French, but the little man was an Italian
returned the jailer, with a passing look of no particular liking at the other man
said the jailer, putting his little daughter on the outer ledge of the grate
said the jailer, turning his basket upside down to beat the crumbs out
said Monsieur Rigaud, suddenly withdrawing his gaze from this funnel to which they had both involuntarily turned their eyes
Monsieur Rigaud stood up to say it
he demanded after a silence
cried the other, uneasily flinging the end of his cloak over his shoulder with an oath
said he, pausing for a moment at the grate, with his keys in his hands
said he, as he opened it and appeared within
said Mr Meagles, laying his forefinger on his companion's breast with great animation
said the other, when they had taken another silent turn to and fro, and, after standing for a moment at the wall glancing down at the sea, had resumed their walk
said the French gentleman in his own language
she turned her eyes, and Pet faltered
said Pet, sitting down beside her, shyly and half tenderly
said Pet, apologetically and embarrassed by her eyes
said Pet, timidly touching her hand as it lay impassive on the sofa between them
he said, without any emotion
said the old man, turning to look at him with the light raised again, and shaking his head
said Arthur Clennam, when he was gone
said Mrs Clennam, with a slight motion of her worsted- muffled right hand toward a chair on wheels, standing before a tall writing cabinet close shut up
said the old woman, bending over him to whisper
Mrs Flintwinch cast about in her mind with great pains for this form of expression
snarled Jeremiah, referring to his watch
said Mr Flintwinch, with a friendly grin on his expressive countenance
she returned, without answering his question
she returned, fixing her eyes upon him
her son leaned forward to be the nearer to her while he whispered it, and laid his hand nervously upon her desk
returned Arthur, finding it left to him to speak
she said after a short pause
said the turnkey, offering his suggestions from the the top of his well-worn wooden stool, as he might have offered them to a child for whose weakness he felt a compassion
responded the practical turnkey, taking him by the elbow
said Mrs Bangham as the door opened
said the doctor, before he had been there twenty minutes
said the turnkey, one snowy winter's night when the lodge, with a bright fire in it, was pretty full of company
the collegian would usually return
said the Plasterer, putting a little pile of halfpence in his hand
remarked the turnkey when she was first shown to him
the turnkey said once, after watching her
the turnkey hesitated, being short of floral nomenclature
he would say, stating the case with his key on the professional gentleman's waistcoat
anxiously undrawing the strings of the little bag
she returned in all simplicity
he returned in a reluctant tone
said Arthur, repeating his question
said the old man, with the air of deeming it not quite necessary to insist upon that designation
said Arthur, stopping him once more
replied the old man; plainly adding by the significance of his emphasis
replied the old man most unexpectedly
said the old man, pausing on the step and slowly facing round again
said Arthur, very doubtful what to say
returned the other, rising, taking his cap off in the flat of his hand, and so holding it, ready to put on again
he shrugged his shoulders with a faint sigh, and looked round the room
he went on in a low, soft voice, agitated, and clearing his throat every now and then
he said, with his ragged clarionet case under his arm
said the uncle, looking back as he shuffled out after them
said he, very slowly remembering Arthur
said Arthur, very much at a loss, for his thoughts were on the brother before him
said Clennam, very nearly adding
she said, with a prouder air, as the misgiving evidently crept upon her that she might seem to be abandoning him
the word home jarred upon him
said Little Dorrit, rather confused
said Little Dorrit, watching her face while she spoke
said Little Dorrit, turning towards Arthur for an instant and speaking low
said Little Dorrit, in her former tone of telling a child's story; the tone designed for Maggy's ear
said Little Dorrit, clapping the two great hands together again
said Barnacle junior, taking heed of his visitor's brown face
said Barnacle junior, calling after him when he got to the door, unwilling wholly to relinquish the bright business idea he had conceived
mentioning that obscure body with reluctance, as his natural enemy
returned Mr Barnacle, ringing the bell
Mr Barnacle was always checked a little by that word of impertinent signification
said Arthur Clennam, who had made up his mind to persistence in one short form of words
to the mashed potatoes messenger
said the gentleman with the gun-barrel, who was an extremely deliberate speaker
pursued this bright young Barnacle
said Mr Meagles, in a threatening kind of Way
returned Arthur Clennam, observing a faint smile in Daniel Doyce's face
said Arthur Clennam, looking at him with some wonder
he replied in his steady, planning way, and looking into the distance before him as if his grey eye were measuring it
said one of them, bringing a story he had been telling, to a close
said the landlady, putting down her work, and rising to take the stranger's soup from her husband, who appeared with it at a side door
cried Lagnier, giving his head a twirl
he said at last, as if he were forced to the admission
he went on in the same way
said Mrs Plornish, a civil woman
said Mrs Plornish, lifting up her eyebrows, and searching for a solution of the problem between the bars of the grate
said Plornish, taking a chair, and lifting the elder child upon his knee, that he might have the moral support of speaking to a stranger over his head
said Plornish, lowering his voice, and speaking with a perverse admiration of what he ought to have pitied or despised
said Sally, hushing the baby from side to side, and laying her chin upon the little hand as it tried to disarrange the gown again
Plornish repeated, no ill- conwenience
Plornish repeated job just then
added Mr Plornish, dwelling on the subject with a slow thoughtfulness that appeared to have no connection with any specific object, and to lead him nowhere
meaning, not a singer of anthems, but a seller of horses -- and that he (Plornish) considered that ten shillings in the pound
thought Clennam, as he crossed to the door
had cried in a rapture of disappointment
said Arthur, catching at the opportunity as it drifted past him
giggled Flora, tossing her head with a caricature of her girlish manner, such as a mummer might have presented at her own funeral, if she had lived and died in classical antiquity
cried Flora with a little scream
said Flora, who, whatever she said, never once came to a full stop
said Flora, running on with astonishing speed, and pointing her conversation with nothing but commas, and very few of them
returned Arthur, smiling in spite of himself
said Flora, in a positive tone
said Flora, giving their conversation, without the slightest notice and to the great terror of Clennam, the tone of a love-quarrel
proceeded Flora with unslackened volubility
said Arthur, with the cheerfulest readiness
proceeded Flora, rejecting commonplace life with a wave of her hand
snorted Pancks, taking one of his dirty hands out of his rusty iron-grey pockets to bite his nails, if he could find any, and turning his beads of eyes upon his employer
argued the first old man
said the surgeon, continuing his examination with a businesslike delight in it
he added, in that tongue
he had happened to touch it, while stooping on one knee at his work of kindling the fire
Little Dorrit began, sitting before the pale fire, and raising her eyes again to the face which in its harmonious look of interest, and pity, and protection, she felt to be a mystery far above her in degree, and almost removed beyond her guessing at
said Little Dorrit, trembling in all her little figure and in her voice
said Little Dorrit, trembling more and more
child was on his lips again
she answered, subduing herself with the quiet effort that had long been natural to her
said Little Dorrit, glancing at her charge
she added, with the quiet effort again
mused Clennam, still looking at the fire
said Little Dorrit, looking at him in a suppliant way, and gradually withdrawing her eyes as he looked at her
said Clennam; and the phrase had already begun, between these two, to stand for a hundred gentle phrases, according to the varying tone and connection in which it was used
said Little Dorrit, as he softly put her glass towards her
said Little Dorrit, folding her small hands tight in one another, and looking at him with all the earnestness of her soul looking steadily out of her eyes
cried Little Dorrit, covering her tears with her hands
she dried her tears quickly
said Little Dorrit, kissing one of the bars
she said, bending her face
said Little Dorrit, recognising the sexton, or the beadle, or the verger, or whatever he was
returned Mrs Clennam, in her usual strong low voice
Jeremiah chuckled at having forced her to adopt his phrase
Affery's liege lord then demanded in a much lower voice, and with an amount of expression that seemed quite out of proportion to the simple purpose of his words
said Mrs Clennam, speaking in one unmodulated hard voice, and separating her words as distinctly as if she were reading them off from separate bits of metal that she took up one by one
said his mistress and partner, flashing into a sudden energy that made Affery start
said Mr Flintwinch grimly, after advancing his nose to that lady's lips as a test for the detection of spirituous liquors
said Arthur, as they walked on together
said Arthur, with a growing admiration of his quiet companion
he said, stopping for a moment with a good-humoured laugh in his eyes, and laying his closed right hand, with its peculiar suppleness of thumb, on Clennam's arm
said Doyce, nodding towards Twickenham
said Daniel Doyce, taking off his hat to pass his hand over his forehead
cried Mr Meagles, rubbing his hands with a relish
said Clennam -- then he recalled what Little Dorrit had said to him in his own room, and faithfully added
said Clennam, glancing from the fair original to the picture and back
she said, looking at Mr Meagles
she looked down at her young mistress
she looked down at her again
said her young mistress, putting her hand up over her shoulder that the other might take it
he said, on their being left alone
said Mr Meagles, evidently meaning nothing more than that he did new things and went new ways
said Mr Meagles, even suppressing a sigh
she returned, trembling, but in a quiet way
said the object of his affectionate consideration
returned the Father of the Marshalsea
the Father of the Marshalsea in his mild wisdom persisted
said the Father of the Marshalsea, laying his hand upon his shoulder, and mildly rallying him -- mildly, because of his weakness, poor dear soul
turning his hands over and over and looking closely at them
he cried, looking haggardly about
said Fanny, doing as the rest did
and the gentleman with the black hair looking round his old beam, and saying
said the Daughter of the Father of the Marshalsea
said Fanny, in whom there was a singular mixture of deference and hardihood
she began again, addressing Little Dorrit
said Mrs Merdle from her nest of crimson and gold -- and there put up her glass to refresh her memory as to whom she was addressing
said Fanny, with a heightening colour
said Mrs Merdle, after frostily looking at her through her glass
said Mrs Merdle, reviewing the breadth of bosom which seemed essential to her having room enough to be unfeeling in
Fanny pouted, with a toss of her gauzy bonnet
added Mrs Merdle, quitting her nest, and putting something in Fanny's hand
she resumed when they were seated in sisterly accord side by side
pursued her sister, gradually beginning to patronise
said Bishop magnate to Horse Guards
smiling Treasury turned him by the arm towards the sideboard and spoke banteringly
said Mr Chivery in a secret manner
said Mr Chivery, answering Clennam's look of apprehension with a nod
returned Arthur, at a loss
said Mrs Chivery, with a sort of triumphant shiver
and if he goes into the George and writes a letter and if he gives it me and says
he opened the business by saying
said he, with a cordial shake of the hand
observed Clennam, by this time pretty well bewildered
said Arthur, with a sudden interest in the conversation
pouted Flora, coming to a sudden stop in a captivating bashfulness
said the Patriarch with his benevolent smile
said Arthur, after making his acknowledgments; the relict of the late Mr F. meanwhile protesting, with a gesture, against his use of that respectable name
said Arthur, hazarding a random question
too evidently meaning Clennam -- wanted to get rid of her
said Pancks, making a note of the case in his book
said he, to excuse himself
Flora went on, busily arranging Mr F.'s Aunt's toast
said Flora, measuring out a spoonful or two of some brown liquid that smelt like brandy, and putting it into her tea
asked Little Dorrit, looking timidly about
returned Flora, taking, in another cup of tea, another of the doses prescribed by her medical man
said Flora, who had a decided tendency to be always honest when she gave herself time to think about it
muttered Pancks, tracing out a line in her hand with his clumsy finger
faltered Little Dorrit, whom he greatly confused
said Maggy, panting for breath
said Mr Rugg, challenging him specially in that character
said Mr Rugg, who was a man of many words, and was considered to possess a remarkably good address
Mr Rugg might have used the word more pointedly in the singular number
said Mr Rugg, taking him by the hand
Young John added with simplicity
he said anxiously, as he pushed a portion to each of his male companions
returned Doyce, as he entered
cried Clennam with unusual vivacity
said Clennam, almost in the tone of a man in pain
said Clennam, ill at ease
cried Gowan, with that characteristic balancing of his which reduced everything in the wide world to the same light weight
said Mrs Gowan, after the degeneracy of the times had been fully ascertained
returned Mrs Gowan, shaking her head
said Mr Meagles, after a moment's pause
said Mr Meagles, with a heavy sigh
said Mr Meagles, a little disturbed by the question, for he was far more intent on softening her case than the family's
said Mr Meagles, shaking him by the hand
said Clennam, after a moment's reflection
said Mr Meagles, persuasively, as if the provocation to be angry were not his own at all
assented Clennam in the same tone
she said (and the voice was the same that had spoken before
Arthur Clennam interposed, seeing Mr Meagles rather at a loss
she glanced at them for a moment
said the girl, with her bosom swelling high, and speaking with her hand held to her throat
at length said Clennam, smiling
she spoke with great agitation
said Pet, more moved by, and more pretty in, her innocent grief, than Clennam could trust himself even to consider -- for which reason he counted the trees between them and the fading light as they slowly diminished in number
said he, using that familiar address for the first time in their communication
said Mr Meagles, much subdued
she said, when she at last broke silence
said Mrs Clennam, with her unbent finger again pointing to the door
said Little Dorrit, in her soft voice, and timid uncomplaining way
cried Mistress Affery, wringing her hands in this last uneasy dream of all
cried Affery, driven into a frantic dance by these accumulated considerations
he said, as he took back his cloak and threw it on
and then turned to the stranger and said to him
said Jeremiah, closing the house door, and taking a pretty sharp survey of the smiling visitor in his turn
returned Mr Blandois, passing his white hand down his high-hooked nose
returned that gentleman, shrugging his cloaked shoulders
said Mr Flintwinch, with more than his usual deliberation, as he met, for a moment, Mr Blandois' shining eyes, which were restless
said the visitor, on his saying so
she proceeded with merely a slight turn of her eyes in jeremiah's direction
said Mr Blandois, with an ugly fall of his eyebrows
her mistress was the first to say
he added in her ear
said Mr Blandois, replacing the watch and stepping backward to his former chair
said Mr Blandois, with his smoothest bow and his white hand on his breast
she looked at the rigid pile of hard pale books before her
he remarked, with a sudden sprightliness of manner, looking round when he got near the door
said Mr Flintwinch, grimly screwing himself at his questioner
returned the other, taking him by the collar with both hands
those flecks of light in his flat vista of pollard old men
said Mrs Plornish with a lengthening face
said Little Dorrit, always thoughtful of the feelings of the weak
returned the young lady with burning indignation
said Little Dorrit, very gently
Fanny paused for a sufficiently strong expression
said the father, passing his pocket-handkerchief several times across his face, and then grasping it convulsively in the hand that dropped across his knee
said Little Dorrit, her heart well-nigh broken
attention more distracted than before
said the Father, when Young John had closed the door
remarked the Father complacently and in a half whisper to Little Dorrit
he explained to the company
and on his not instantly replying, observed
said Little Dorrit, mildly, shocked by this
answered Tip, jerking his head with emphasis towards his shoulder nearest Clennam
added the lofty young man, after a moment's pause
returned the Father, in a great heat
said the Father, with a removal of his black cap and a grasp of Clennam's hand, combining to express the safe receipt of his note and enclosure that afternoon
said Clennam, abiding by the feeling that had fallen on him in the avenue on the night of the roses, the feeling that he was an older man, who had done with that tender part of life
he said, taking her hand again, and speaking lower than he had spoken yet, so that even Maggy in the small room could not hear him
he observed out of breath
said Mrs Gowan, tapping the back of her friend's hand with this fan after a little indifferent conversation
said Mrs Merdle, delicately crooking the little finger of her favourite hand, and making her remarks neater by that neat action
said Mrs Merdle, leaning back in her nest and putting up her glass again
said Mrs Gowan not quite so sweetly as before
said Mrs Gowan, shaking her despondent head
repeated Mrs Gowan, furling her green fan for the moment, and tapping her chin with it (it was on the way to being a double chin; might be called a chin and a half at present
he said, stopping short in confusion
said Mr Merdle, with his wounded finger in his mouth
retorted that gentleman, wiping his dull red and yellow face
repeated Mr Merdle, with a wild emphasis that made his wife lift up her eyelids
said Mrs Merdle, reposing easily among her cushions
pursued the lady, disregarding the low remark
said Mrs Merdle, waving her favourite hand towards her husband
said Mr Sparkler, after feeling his pulse as before
said Mrs Merdle, rising, with her floating drapery about her
he happened to remark in the course of conversation one day, when they were walking near the Cottage within a week of the marriage
said Clennam, a little embarrassed
cried the other, with enthusiasm
Mr Pancks pursued, appearing greatly to relish this descriptive epithet
she said, all mystery and whisper, as she shut down the tea-pot lid
said Flora, putting her hands to her ears and moving towards the door
said Clennam, slowly and distinctly
said Arthur, laying his purse on the table
he said, jogging about in a more feverish flutter than before
said the other, shaking his head
said the other weakly, and with a sigh
cried Miss Fanny all at once
said the young lady, who was rather reserved and haughty
to the former young lady
to the other and younger lady, who immediately did so; while the former merely said
said the gentleman in a subdued tone
said the lofty gentleman, with the air of finally disposing of the subject
he inquired of the host, over his soup
smiling sedately, as he cut up the dish of veal to be handed round, on the young man who had been put out of countenance
he coldly inquired across the table of his companion
said he, in his former tone
said the lady, smiling on her
said the traveller, pulling his moustache dry with his hand, for he had dipped it in the wine and brandy
returned Mrs General, stopping the word
returned that young gentleman with a frown
said Mr Dorrit, raising his eyebrows
said Mr Dorrit, turning to his younger daughter
Miss Fanny struck in before she could answer
said Mr Dorrit, tempering a bland severity with a dignified affection
this young lady was in the habit of declaring the same thing once for all every day of her life, and even several times in a day
observed her brother, shaking his head
retorted Fanny, determined not to admit anything in extenuation
said he to his younger daughter
here Mr Dorrit became extremely grave and impressive
said Mr Dorrit, reddening excessively
said Mr Dorrit, panting with anger
said the other gentleman, retiring on his main position
said the lady from the doorway
said the lady, gracefully advancing a step or two towards Mr Dorrit
said Mr Dorrit again, with the magnificent placidity of one who was above correction
said Mr Dorrit, summing up with judicial gravity
said Mrs General, with a little touch of varnish
said Mr Dorrit, 'I took the liberty' (he laid an emphasis on the phrase and repeated it, as though he stipulated, with urbane firmness, that he must not be contradicted again
resumed Mr Dorrit, ringing his little bell to summon his valet
Mrs General shut her eyes
said Mr Dorrit, looking all about the ceiling of the room, and never at the attentive, uncomplainingly shocked face
inquired Little Dorrit, with diffidence and hesitation
Mr Dorrit observed, with a decided change in his manner
said Mr Dorrit, in an encouraging and forgiving manner
said the old man, conveying a surprising energy into his trembling voice
said the old man, turning round on Fanny
cried Fanny, affrighted and bursting into tears
cried Miss Fanny, sobbing and weeping
said Mr Dorrit, recovering his tone, though he remained unusually pale
returned Mr Dorrit in a deeply fraternal tone
and which took them through a complexity of narrow streets of water, which the same lady disparaged as
returned Gowan, touching the painted face with his brush in the part where the real face had moved
said Gowan, putting in the markings of the hand with a quick, impatient, unskilful touch
she returned in the same breath
returned Fanny (in a tone suggesting that before her Uncle's protest she might have said, You little fool, instead
said Fanny, almost as well composed in the graceful indifference of her attitude as Mrs Merdle herself
observed Miss Fanny, glancing complacently at herself
said her sister, smiling contemptuously
answered Fanny, with supreme indifference
said his host at dinner
said Mr Dorrit, with a patronage as magnificent as that of Lord Decimus himself
said Blandois, smiling and shrugging his shoulders
said Fanny to her one night when they were alone, after a day so tiring that Little Dorrit was quite worn out, though Fanny would have taken another dip into society with the greatest pleasure in life
rejoined that young lady with exceeding indifference
said Gowan, laughing, after receiving it gracefully enough
and here he laughed again in the easiest way
said Mrs Merdle, turning the bosom towards that gentleman
observed Fanny, as a means of dismissing Mr Sparkler into the background
said Mrs Merdle, who had been looking admiringly at Fanny through her eye-glass
said Daniel, in his steady even way
cried Clennam, starting up and taking his work- roughened hand
said Mrs Gowan, without straining her attention on the answers she received
returned the lady, tapping him on the arm with the green fan and then adroitly interposing it between a yawn and the company
exclaimed Mrs Gowan cheerfully, as if the absurd coincidence then flashed upon her for the first time
retorted Mr Meagles, a little heightened in colour
returned the Dowager, with an affable smile, but with the bloom on her cheeks standing out a little more vividly than usual as the neighbouring surface became paler
said Mr Meagles, at great pains to restrain himself
Mr Meagles himself did not look happy as he spoke the words
said Mrs Gowan, looking about as she fanned herself
said Mrs Gowan, smiling and shaking her head with accusatory intelligence
said Clennam, looked to by all parties
said Mr Meagles, on the evening of the following day
replied Arthur, touched by the motherly anticipation in the bright face of Mrs Meagles (she must have been very like her daughter, once
said Mr Meagles, the old cloud coming over his face
said Mr Meagles, adding a new version to the proverb
said Mr Meagles, turning it over
returned that faithful housekeeper, having taken him into the parlour and closed the door
Mrs Tickit said this with an argumentative and philosophic air
cried Flora, rising to give him a cordial reception
said Flora, drawing her chair near to his
s Aunt, elevating her voice into a cry of considerable power, exclaimed
said Clennam, doing so, and looking round with a face of blank disappointment
assented the Patriarch, with a shining face as he philanthropically smiled at the fire
Pancks added as a saving clause
said Pancks, extending five cropped coaly finger- nails on Arthur's arm
said Arthur aloud and sternly, as he surveyed him from head to foot with indignation
the stranger repeated in his turn
said Arthur, striking in expeditiously
said Mrs Clennam, always intent on Blandois, however directly she addressed her son
her habitual frown became stronger, as she very slowly and weightily emphasised those words
said Blandois, standing astride before the fire, and so evidently saying it to arrest Clennam's retreating steps, that he lingered near the door
whispered Clennam, as she opened the door for him in the dark hall, and he groped his way to the sight of the night-sky
said the sprightly young Barnacle, whose name was Ferdinand
said Bar, nodding his head, for he was not to be put off in that way
said Bar, with a little jocose roll of his head; for, in his legal current of speech, he always assumed the air of rallying himself with the best grace in the world
down to the rich conclusion
said Bar, with the jury droop
pursued Bar, with a bright twinkle in his keen eye, as it slightly turned in the direction of his magnificent neighbour
asked Lord Decimus, casting his eyes around the table
this sparkling young Barnacle threw off the phrase sportively, as who should say, We know all about these forms of speech, but we must keep it up, we must keep the game alive
said this handsome young Barnacle, laughing heartily
the Defaulter would go on with rising spirits
said Mrs Plornish, lowering her voice
Mrs Plornish then interpreted, addressing her father and Pancks with mild condescension
inquired Mrs Plornish, reverting to the Italian language
returned the little foreigner whom she so considerately protected
said Arthur, when they got into the street
observed Clennam, who was a little at a loss how to take his friend
Clennam had already passed to that word
he said, when there was a favourable pause
was his exclamation then, with a startling touch on Clennam's knee
replied the young lady, turning angry again
said Fanny, when her sister's gentleness had calmed her
Little Dorrit interposed in her zealous admiration
said Fanny, without answering the question
retorted Fanny, parodying her words
she said in a sterner way
said Fanny with a sigh
said Mr Sparkler, with deference
proceeded Mr Sparkler, growing, in comparison with his oratorical antecedents, quite diffuse
here she held a review of herself before adding at her leisure
said Mrs Merdle in return, smiling her best smile
returned Fanny, taking him up short upon that name
repeated Mr Dorrit in reproachful astonishment
gasped Mr Dorrit, after a majestic silence
Fanny broke in with pointed significance
returned Mrs General, with her gloved hands resting on one another in exemplary repose
said Fanny, returning the smile with one in which there was no trace of those ingredients
said she, seeking her out one day
cried Fanny, half tolerant and half impatient
she spoke of Mrs Merdle, of course
said Fanny, weighing her bonnet by the strings with considerable impatience
asked Little Dorrit, persuasively, after a short hesitation
cried Fanny with an air of resignation
she said to her sister
said Mr Dorrit, taking her by the hand
he added after a moment
he said, looking Mr Dorrit in the face for the first time, and immediately afterwards dropping his eyes to the buttons of Mr Dorrit's waistcoat
said Mr Merdle, after turning his tongue again
said Mr Merdle, curiously interested in the pattern of the carpet
said Mr Merdle, now deeply intent upon a dust-cart that was passing the windows
said Mr Merdle, suddenly getting up, as if he had been waiting in the interval for his legs and they had just come
said Mr Dorrit, turning upon him with grievous indignation
emphasising the name as if the innocent man were solely responsible for it
said Mr Dorrit, standing with the card in his hand, and with an air which imported that it would scarcely have been a first-class pleasure if he had had it
said Mr Dorrit, recovering his breath by a great effort, as the relict of the late Mr Finching stopped to take hers
said Mr Dorrit, very red in the face
said Mr Dorrit, with his ideas in wild confusion
he repeated it with a raised voice in mere desperation
said Mr Dorrit, referring to the handbill again
said Flora, upon whom his condition wrought its effect, though she was quite unconscious of having produced it
said Mr Dorrit, with a growing fancy upon him as he recovered his importance, that he was in some superior way in the Commission of the Peace
observed Mr Dorrit, glancing from Mrs Clennam to Mr Flintwinch, and from Mr Flintwinch to Mrs Clennam
she pursued after an awkward silence on Mr Dorrit's part
Mrs Clennam sternly reminded him
said he, sidling at her with his fists clenched, and his elbows quivering with impatience to shake her
he told her at parting
said Fanny, before whom Mrs General instantly loomed
cried Mr Dorrit, quite beside himself
said Young John, with emotion
said Mr Dorrit, giving his hand a final pressure, and releasing it
returned Little Dorrit, plying her needle
said the old man admiringly
returned his brother with an elaboration of fraternity in which there was severity
said Mr Dorrit, with a reproachful frost upon him
said Mr Dorrit, with an accusatory emphasis
returned Mr Dorrit, with an astonishing superiority to his brother's failing powers
returned Mrs General, with her gloves again somewhat excited
Mrs General repeated, in an elegantly impressive manner
retorted Mrs General, in her former impressive manner
said Mrs General, with a slightly interrogative action of her gloves
said Mrs General, casting down her eyes as she rose with a bend
she returned, motioning him to a chair so coldly that he remained standing
and the handsome face looked bitterly at him
said Arthur, persevering, in his endeavour to soften her scornful demeanour
said Clennam, changing the form of his position in the hope of making it unobjectionable
she said, with a cruel pleasure in repeating the stab
said Arthur, smarting under these cool-handed thrusts, of which he had deeply felt the force already
said Arthur, in spite of his resolutions
returned Miss Wade with infinite contempt
said Miss Wade, coldly subduing and removing her glance
retorted Harriet in her turn
said the girl, flushing high
said Miss Wade, with no less anger, haughtiness, and bitterness
she returned, instantly assuming the tone of superiority she had always so thinly concealed
continued Doyce, laying that plastic workman's thumb of his on the lapel of his partner's coat
said Daniel, looking at his watch
Clennam was quick with his exception, for his partner's face was quick in suggesting it
said Mr Baptist, formerly Cavalletto, who usually went back to his native construction of sentences when his memory went near home
Mr Baptist crept closer again to whisper it
peculiarly belonging to his own language, and which did not serve to render it less terrible to Clennam, he suddenly sprang to his feet, pounced upon the bill again, and with a vehemence that would have been absolute madness in any man of Northern origin, cried
returned Mr Flintwinch, quite at his leisure
returned Mr Flintwinch, scraping his horny cheek
glancing up at the windows
said Mr Flintwinch, screwing himself at him
said she, holding up her hand
when Mr Flintwinch stopped her with
returned Arthur, suiting the action to the word
said Mrs Sparkler, raising her eyes to him after another minute
said Fanny, yawning in a dreary manner
returned his wife, more wearily yet
said Mr Sparkler, flashing with an original conception
returned Mr Sparkler, rather gratified
retorted Fanny with great irritability
observed Fanny with a resigned toss of her fan
returned Fanny, with great indignation
she said, when she had in some measure recovered from her sense of personal ill-usage
she said, stretching out her fan, and touching him with it at arm's length
interrogatively, but he saw his danger and said it assentingly
returned his wife, languidly turning her eyelids a little in his direction (she held forth, in general, as if to the drawing-room furniture
she pursued, when she reopened her eyelids
said Bar; and he looked as if it could have been no other bird than a magpie
said the physician aloud to the master
pursued Clennam, without attending to him
said Clennam, more in commiseration than retaliation
exclaimed Pancks, loosening his hold of his hair
said Clennam, brushing away some tears that had been silently dropping down his face
said Clennam, nerving himself to go through with what he had resolved upon, and surprising that gentleman by appearing, in his despondency, to have a settled determination of purpose
said Mr Rugg, getting between him and the door
said Arthur, in his dejection
said Mr Chivery, without advancing
said Young John in a voice of mild and soft explanation
he at length said, compressing his green packet with some force
returned Arthur, with a sigh and a smile
John went on, scouring a very prairie of wild words
said Arthur, when he had retraced the conversation to the water-cresses and back again
he said, with cordial admiration
John repeated with returning scorn
exclaimed Young John, surveying him in a doleful maze
said Mrs Plornish, winding up in the Italian manner
the good woman went on
Mrs Plornish repeated those words
Mrs Plornish concluded, with the air of a very precise legal witness
said the engaging young Barnacle
said the easy young Barnacle
said Ferdinand in a very friendly and confiding way
he said, as Clennam gave him his hand with a real feeling of thankfulness for his candour and good-humour
said Mr Rugg, more coaxingly yet
said Mr Rugg, with sarcasm
said Monsieur Blandois, otherwise Lagnier, otherwise Rigaud
it would have given Mrs Plornish great concern if she could have been persuaded that his occasional lengthening of an adverb in this way, was the chief fault of his English
said Cavalletto, thrice throwing out his left hand with all its fingers spread, and doing it so rapidly that the sense of sight could hardly follow the action
repeating the same swift performance
At this significant Italian rest on the word
with another rest upon the word
an air of novelty came over Mr Pancks with this designation
such was Mr Baptist's honourable mention of Mr Rugg
returned Arthur, without disguising his abhorrence
said Rigaud, pausing in his drink to look out of his glass with his horrible smile
returned Clennam, with a bitter sense of his helplessness
retorted Rigaud, leisurely, as he took from his pocket a case containing the materials for making cigarettes, and employed his facile hands in folding a few for present use
he said, when he had closely watched the note to its destruction
she cried, weeping bitterly, and holding up her clasped hands in entreaty
said John, looking at it, without coming from the door
repeated John, in a distinct, though quavering voice
said Rigaud, throwing himself into an arm- chair so heavily that the old room trembled
said Mrs Clennam, bending her brows upon him angrily
added Mr Pancks, with an anxious countenance
Mr Pancks pursued, with a longing glance into his hat, where he kept his calculations
said Jeremiah to Mrs Clennam
said Mr Pancks, whose eye had often stealthily wandered to the window-seat and the stocking that was being mended there
said Mr Pancks, taking one step aside towards the window-seat, and laying his right hand upon the stocking
she interrupted in her steady tones
he glanced around the room and smiled
said Rigaud, tapping her on the arm, as if his cruel hand were sounding a musical instrument
she went on addressing him
she went on in her torrent of indignation and defence
she added quickly, as colour flushed into her face
cried Rigaud, rallying him as he poked and jerked him back with his elbows
said Affery, with a shiver
she said in a stronger tone
the blundering old booby could not resist the temptation of trying it again
said the Patriarch, finishing his mixture, and rising with an amiable air
said Mr Pancks, surveying it with anything rather than admiration
said Mr Pancks, breaking off and looking round
said Mr Pancks, closing upon his late Proprietor again, from whom he had withdrawn a little for the better display of him to the Yard
said Mr Meagles, clearing his throat
said Mr Meagles, in a comfortable, managing, not to say coaxing voice
she interrupted, with a smile
Mr Meagles's voice here became comfortable again
continued Mr Meagles, whose heart was overflowing with Pet
cried Mr Meagles, more breathless than before
cried Tattycoram, weeping much more
cried Tattycoram, in a closing great burst of distress
said Mr Meagles, suddenly drooping
said Little Dorrit, raising her eyes to his
said Little Dorrit, after hesitating
returned Flora, giving her an honest kiss
said Flora, with great enjoyment
said her delighted voice outside the door
said Mr Meagles, shaking him by the hand stoutly
said Mr Meagles, shaking his head very seriously
said Doyce, proceeding to mould them severally, with his plastic thumb, on the palm of his hand
she answered, laughing with glistening eyes and standing on tiptoe to kiss him
said Little Dorrit's old friend
