said Mr Dombey, making a fictitious autograph on his knee
he added, pausing for a moment at the settee before the fire
said Doctor Parker Peps in a round, deep, sonorous voice, muffled for the occasion, like the knocker
said the family practitioner faintly: bowing at the same time to the Doctor, as much as to say
returned her brother -- for Mr Dombey was her brother
said Louisa, sitting down, and taking out her pocket-handkerchief
said Louisa; smiling through her tears, which indeed were not overpowering
said a very bland female voice outside
said Louisa in a low voice, as she rose from her seat
said Miss Tox, with a prodigious curtsey
pursued Mrs Chick, still retaining her hand
pursued his sister, pressing the foot of the wine-glass on Miss Tox's hand, at each of the three clauses
said Miss Toxin a tone of low and earnest entreaty
that lady broke out afresh, after silently contemplating his features for a few moments
said Mrs Chick, with a sweet smile
exclaimed his sister, as he returned
she continued, taking off her bonnet, and adjusting her cap and gloves, in a business-like manner
said Mrs Chick, with assumed lightness
said the sister-in-law, altering her position, and speaking less confidently, and more earnestly, in spite of herself
retorted his helpmate, after a short pause
here she dried her eyes
said Miss Tox, pointing out the apple-faced man
said Miss Tox, looking round upon the family
said Mr Dombey, turning round in his easy chair, as one piece, and not as a man with limbs and joints
said Mr Dombey, frustrated in his intention of impressing his views still more distinctly on the husband, as the stronger character
inquired Mr Dombey; looking at him with marked displeasure
returned the child, with tears springing to her eyes
returned Polly, seizing her advantage
said Polly, nodding to her with an encouraging smile upon her wholesome face
said Spitfire, with a giggle
said Richards, with another curtsey
said Mr Dombey, with a frown
he said sharply, as if there had been no interval since she proposed it
said the boy, affecting to make light of it, while the tears stood in his eyes
interposed his nephew, speaking very fast and loud
he said, arranging his hair (which was thin) with his hook, and then pointing it at the Instrument-maker
he said, with a sigh
said Mr Dombey, one day, to his sister
retorted Mrs Chick, with an extraordinary show of animation, to cover the suddenness of her conversion
said Mr Dombey, after a short pause
cried Mrs Chick, hastening to anticipate a refusal
she remonstrated with tearful dignity
added Mrs Chick with increased dignity, as if she had withheld her crushing argument until now
he said (Mrs Chick had nailed her colours to the mast, and repeated
but he took no notice of it
said Mrs Chick, in deep confidence
said the child, looking earnestly up in her face
said Miss Tox apart to Mrs Chick
said Miss Tox, with a soft shower of kisses at each repetition of the adjective
said Susan, who was not by any means discriminating in her wrath
pursued Spitfire, shaking her head resolutely
Mrs Chick murmured, as she embraced him
said Mr Dombey, slightly turning his head in his cravat, as if it were a socket
said Mrs Chick, who had much ado to keep her teeth from chattering
said Mr Chick, making a desperate plunge, after a long silence, and filling a glass of sherry
said Mr Dombey, with severe gravity
said Mrs Chick, with enthusiasm
said Mrs Chick, who prided herself on taking trustful views of human nature
retorted Nipper, who had been admitted to her confidence
said Good Mrs Brown, taking her own seat on the bones
she said, running her eyes over the child's slight figure
said the old woman, ruffling her curls with a furious pleasure
said Walter, glancing at her foot
said Walter, brightening with a generous thought
said Walter, looking after him as they turned away also
he continued, catching up a candle
said Solomon, who, with his spectacles on his forehead and the great chronometer in his pocket, was incessantly oscillating between Florence on the sofa, and his nephew in all parts of the parlour
said Walter, rushing up to him
interrupted Mr Dombey, regarding the boy's evident pride and pleasure in his share of the transaction with an instinctive dislike
said Mr Dombey, suddenly and almost fiercely
said Miss Tox, in a plaintive whisper
said Mr Dombey, emphatically repeating these two words
here Miss Nipper sobbed aloud
Mr Dombey stopped and winced
and between whom and herself, an occasional interchange of newspapers and pamphlets, and such Platonic dalliance, was effected through the medium of a dark servant of the Major's who Miss Tox was quite content to classify as a
the Major would say, with a flourish of his walking-stick
observed the Major, with his usual gallantry
said the Major, rolling his lobster eyes round and round Princess's Place, and apostrophizing its fragrant air
said the Major, shutting up the glass again
said the child, laying his hands upon the elbows of his little chair, and turning the old face up towards Mr Dombey's
said the little fellow, thoughtfully, as he looked back at the fire
said little Paul, warming his hands, and looking in between the bars of the grate, as if some ghostly puppet-show were performing there
said Mr Dombey, drawing his own chair closer to his son's, and laying his hand gently on his back
said Mr Dombey, interrupting her testily
said Mrs Chick, after a moment's silence
said Mrs Chick, in a warning voice
said Mrs Chick, in the tone of one who was summing up what had been previously quite agreed upon, instead of saying it all for the first time
said Mrs Chick, glancing at her brother; and it really did seem necessary to offer the explanation, for Miss Tox had spoken of him as if he had died at the handle
observed Miss Tox, with an ingenuous blush
said Miss Tox, with peculiar sweetness
said Mrs Pipchin to Paul
Mrs Wickam went on to say
said Mrs Wickam, lowering her voice, and looking round the room, and towards Paul in bed
said Berry, gently doing what she was asked
returned Mrs Wickam in her most solemn tones
said Mrs Wickam after a pause
sighed Mrs Wickam, and she shook her head again, expressing to the watchful Berry
said Paul, after being silent for a minute
pursued Walter, bending over a little more to pat him on the shoulder
returned the Captain, mending his pace
said the Captain, with the solemnity of a man who was delivering himself of one of the most precious practical tenets ever discovered by human wisdom
returned old Sol, first putting his hands into his empty pockets, and then squeezing his Welsh wig between them, as if he thought he might wring some gold out of it
said Sol, in resigned despair
said the old man, pointing feebly to the wooden Midshipman
said the Captain, again administering that unanswerable piece of consolation
as he was used to observe with chuckles at his club
cried the Major with sudden warmth
said the Major firmly, as if he defied Mr Dombey to contradict him, and would feel it his painful duty to bully him if he did
croaked the Major, looking as amiably as he could, on Paul
said the Major in a lower tone
said Miss Tox to Mrs Chick, when they were alone together, on the morning of the appointed day
replied Miss Tox, with every demonstration of making an effort that rent her soul
began Walter, trembling, and looking down at the ground
pursued Walter, raising his eyes with a look of entreaty in the Captain's behalf
said Walter, venturing to meet Mr Dombey's eye, and proceeding with better courage in the very desperation of the case, now that there was no avoiding it
added Walter, after a moment's hesitation
added the Captain, in one of his happy quotations
said Mr Dombey, unobservant of the Captain's mysterious signs behind Walter, and still looking at his son
he added, dropping his voice
she said, addressing Mr Dombey, at whose munificence both she and Mrs Chick were shedding tears copiously
pursued Miss Tox, glancing at Captain Cuttle
said Mrs Pipchin, taking a chair and fetching her breath
pursued Mr Dombey, stretching out his forefinger
croaked the unsympathetic Pipchin, with a frosty glistening of her hard grey eye, and a dreary shaking of her bent head
said Mr Dombey, quickly answering what he mistrusted was a shrewd twinkle of the frosty eye
said Mr Dombey, hitching his chair anxiously a little nearer to the fire
he said to Mr Dombey
said his father, in a querulous manner
replied Mr Dombey, introducing Mrs Pipchin, who instantly communicated a rigidity to her whole muscular system, and snorted defiance beforehand, in case the Doctor should disparage her
pursued Mr Dombey, glancing at his little son
for the lady, who had perhaps been in waiting, opportunely entered, followed by her daughter, that fair Sexton in spectacles
pursued the Doctor, turning to his wife
said Mrs Blimber, with uplifted eyes
said the Doctor, laying down his book
said Mr Dombey, wheeling round
said Paul, boldly tendering this information to the very Doctor himself
said the Doctor, shaking his head
said the Doctor, beginning again slowly
said Mr Feeder, in a low reproachful voice
said the Doctor, raising his voice
pursued Doctor Blimber, raising his voice still higher as he looked all round the table
pursued the Doctor, in his severest voice
replied Nipper; adding, in a lower voice
exclaimed Miss Nipper, with strong feeling -- in allusion to Paul's
said Miss Nipper, with great sharpness
and sometimes the servants said among themselves that little Dombey
cried Toots, speaking the moment he entered the room, lest he should forget it
said Mr Carker, shaking his head
he answered, looking up with his widest and almost sudden smile
he murmured, as if he were only thinking it
resumed Mr Carker, taking out one paper from the rest
he said suddenly and angrily, turning on Walter
Mr Carker the Manager began, as soon as they were alone
said Mr Dombey, scorning to embellish the bare truth
said the Manager, when this was done, turning suddenly upon his brother, with his two rows of teeth bristling as if he would have bitten him
assented his brother with keen emphasis
added Walter, after a moment's pause
said the Manager, taking him up quickly
said Mr Carker the Manager, warming himself with great and increased satisfaction
striking himself upon the breast
returned his brother, speaking for the first time in an accent of reproach, and seeming, by the sound of his voice, to have covered his face with his hands
said Miss Blimber breaking off
resumed Miss Blimber, casting her eye over the paper
said Miss Blimber, laying down the paper
said Paul, with a mixture of timidity and perfect frankness, which was one of the most peculiar and most engaging qualities of the child
for they were always kind to him, and glad to see him -- and then said, tossing one of the letters towards him
to Master Skettles, who was revenging himself for the studies to come, on the plum-cake
said Walter, trying to speak gaily
said Walter, handing him the blue coat and waistcoat, and bustling very much
murmured the Captain, in an absent manner
said Captain Cuttle in the same tone
thought the Captain, meaning between Walter and Mr Dombey
cried the coachman, appealing to Walter, with a sort of exalting despair
cried Susan, wringing her hands
said Susan; adding, with excessive sharpness
said Miss Tox, bursting out afresh that night, as if her heart were broken
and he looked wistfully at Walter
said the Captain, with a magnificent sense of the allegory into which he was soaring
said the Captain, raising his voice as much as to say, observe the point of this
said the old man, drawing Walter to his side, and taking his arm tenderly through his
said the old man, fastening on the Captain, to the manifest confusion of that diplomatist
said the Captain in his ear
began the Captain, rolling his eyes slowly round the little room, and taking in as much of it as his shirt-collar permitted
said the Captain, lowering his voice, and speaking in a kind of confidential growl
said the Captain, unspeakably encouraged
said the Captain, eyeing him attentively
said the Captain, with all the secrecy and gravity that the subject demanded
said the Captain, rising gradually to a quotation he was preparing for a final burst
a touch falls gently on his mourning cloak
for which, as Cook says with another sigh
said Mrs Chick, who held it as a duty incumbent on her, to improve the occasion
pursued Mrs Chick, gently squeezing Miss Tox's hand in acknowledgment of her friendly remark
said Miss Tox, much impressed by the originality of the sentiment
observed the good matron, with a resolute air
said Mrs Chick, drying both her eyes at once with great care on opposite corners of Miss Tox's handkerchief
said Mr Toots, after reflecting a little
said Florence, taking up her work
said Florence, with a quiet smile
asked Florence, without looking at her
he said, taking up the light, and leading her towards the door
he said gaily, laying his hand upon the old man's shoulder
said Walter, with his pleasant laugh
said Walter, after a moment's hesitation
said Florence with a smile
said Florence to the old man
said Florence, laying her hand timidly upon the old man's as it rested on the table, to bespeak his attention
he replied, with an effort to recover the cheerful manner he had preserved while talking with his Uncle
added Florence, bursting into tears
said Florence by the way
said Florence, after a moment
she said, looking full upon him with her affectionate eyes
said the Captain on second thoughts
said the other, retaining his hand while he spoke
said the Captain, handing it over, and shaking him heartily by the hand
said the Captain, suddenly diving into one of his pockets and bringing up the two teaspoons and the sugar-tongs, with which he had armed himself to meet such an objection
cried the Major with sudden ferocity
observed the Major, relapsing into a mild state
cried the Major, in another spasm of ferocity
said the Major, stopping short again
replied Mr Dombey with great stateliness
said Mr Dombey, in the tone of a man who was making a great and valuable concession
added Mr Dombey, with a slight wave of his hand
said the Major, with a struggle which it was not very difficult to parade, his whole life being a struggle against all kinds of apoplectic symptoms
he added, raising his eyes from his plate, and casting them across Princess's Place, to where Miss Tox was at that moment visible at her window watering her flowers
said the Major, rolling his head at the unconscious Miss Tox, while his starting eyes appeared to make a leap towards her
cried the Major, again apostrophising his fair neighbour, with great ire
said the Major, wagging his double chin with a jocose air
said Toodle, seeing he was not clearly remembered
said Toodle, turning his oilskin cap round and round
said Toodle, again addressing Mr Dombey individually
said the Major, rapping him on the arm with his cane
said the Major, with a broad stare
drawled the lady in the chair
said the Major to both ladies
said the lady in the chair
returned the lady, slightly settling her false curls and false eyebrows with her fan, and showing her false teeth, set off by her false complexion
said Mrs Skewton, rustling a handkerchief that was faint and sickly with essences
observed Mrs Skewton, with a mincing sigh
drawled Mrs Skewton, pinching her shrivelled throat
said Mr Dombey, after a short pause
returned the Major, stopping short again, and punching a mark in the ground with his cane, to represent her
said the Major, tapping the last ideal portrait, and rolling his head emphatically
replied the Major, shutting one eye, putting his head on one side, passing his cane into his left hand, and smoothing his shirt-frill with his right
said the Major, shouldering his stick once more, and walking on again
said Mr Dombey, advancing a step towards her
said her languishing mother, playing with a hand-screen
returned her mother, making a faint attempt to pat her with the screen, which Edith made no movement to meet
returned the Major, kissing his hand
said Mrs Skewton, arranging her lace tucker, and complacently observing the effect of her bare lean arm, looking upward from the wrist
glancing at the Major, round the screen
observed Mrs Skewton from her couch
he replied, glancing at a variety of landscape drawings, of which he had already recognised several as representing neighbouring points of view, and which were strewn abundantly about the room
said the brother, gathering them up
he said, throwing the still unfolded letter on his desk, and putting his hands firmly in his pockets
said Mr Perch, in a soft voice
added Mr Perch, stopping to shut the door
said Mr Perch, coughing behind his hand again
said Mr Perch, coughing another cough behind his hand, which was always his resource as an expression of humility when nothing else occurred to him
added Perch, dropping his voice to a whisper, and turning, in the inviolable nature of his confidence, to give the door a thrust with his hand and knee, as if that would shut it any more when it was shut already
submitted Mr Perch, after a short silence, and another cough
said Mr Perch, hesitating at the door
said Mr Carker, through his set jaws
said Mr Toodle Junior, with a burst of penitence
said Biler, blubbering outright, and smearing his eyes with his coat-cuff
said Mr Carker, taking him by the throat again, holding him out at arm's-length, and surveying him in silence for some moments
said Carker, with a smile
replied the smiling Manager, taking a paper from one of his many drawers, and making an endorsement on it, while Uncle Sol looked over him
he added aloud, throwing himself back in his chair
said Carker, with his soft hand playing round his mouth, and looking up into the Instrument-maker's face
he added quickly, in anticipation of what the old man was going to say
he answered, rising, and shaking the old man by the hand
said Mr Carker, taking him by the shoulder
cried Rob, in a piteous voice
said Mr Carker to Polly, giving him a gentle shake
sobbed Polly, with a curtsey
returned Polly, checking the baby, who was making convulsive efforts with his arms and legs to launch himself on Biler, through the ambient air
said Mr Carker, pointing to the place they had just left
exclaimed Susan, giving him a push
said Mr Carker, taking off his hat
returned Florence, with a mild correction of that young lady's familiar mention of the family in question
murmured Miss Nipper, drawing in her breath
said Susan Nipper, evidently struggling with some latent anxiety and alarm, and looking full at her young mistress, while endeavouring to work herself into a state of resentment with the unoffending Mr Perch's image
said Miss Nipper, with aggravated scorn
added Susan, after a moment's consideration
which identification had such an effect upon the conscience-stricken pigeons, that instead of going direct to some town in the North of England, as appeared to have been their original intention, they began to wheel and falter; whereupon Mrs Richards's first born pierced them with another whistle, and again yelled, in a voice that rose above the turmoil of the street
said Miss Nipper, with authority
returned Rob, preferring to address himself to Florence and slighting Nipper
said the Captain, his eyes glistening with the praise of his young friend, and his hook raised to announce a beautiful quotation
returned the Captain, kissing his iron hand
said the Captain parenthetically, 'and there you'll find them expressions -- if it would console Sol Gills to have the opinion of a seafaring man as has got a mind equal to any undertaking that he puts it alongside of, and as was all but smashed in his
returned the Captain, in a gruff whisper, and making signals of secrecy.'We had some words about the swabbing of these here planks, and she -- In short
said the Captain, striking home at once
said the Captain, addressing himself to his fair auditors, and indicating the commander with his outstretched hook
said Bunsby, all of a sudden, and stooping down to look out under some interposing spar
said Uncle Sol, looking wistfully over the chart
here the Captain kissed his hook to Florence
said the lady, after another moment of silence
said the lady, whose voice was serious, but very calm and sweet, and had so impressed Florence from the first moment of her hearing it
lifted up his head again, and whistled to her
he answered, looking at her still
said the neighbour, with a smile, in which there was more of secret sympathy than he expressed
said Rob, looking round the room
said the Captain to Rob, when he had matured this notable scheme
resumed the Captain, coming back again to enforce this charge upon his mind
said the Captain, torn to pieces by his conscience
said the unconscious MacStinger, rubbing her hands
said the Captain, taking down the tin canister in which he kept his cash' from the top shelf of the cupboard
said the Major, in reply
said the Major, lowering his voice, but not lowering it so much as to render it inaudible to that gentleman
said Mr Dombey, taking a chair near him
returned Mr Carker, after an impressive pause
said Cleopatra, listlessly waving her fan
observed the Major, dropping into a much nearer chair than had been indicated by his cruel Divinity
returned the Major, with a facetious gurgling in his throat
said Mrs Skewton, tracing the outline of her eyebrows with her forefinger
said Mrs Skewton, trimming her lips with the laced edge of her pocket-handkerchief
said Mrs Skewton, when she at length resumed
cried Mrs Skewton, looking at him languidly
cried Cleopatra, with a little shriek
pursued the Major, thrusting forward his head, and distending his eyes
said the Major, stopping abruptly in a chuckle, and becoming serious
s word for this; for Joe is devilish sly'-- the Major tapped his nose, and screwed up one of his eyes tight: which did not enhance his native beauty
he said, breaking off, and speaking in a charming tone of frankness
said the Major, winking at his new friend, while Mr Dombey looked into his plate with a conscious air
said the Major, laying his finger on his lips, and speaking half apart to Carker
said Mr Dombey, laying himself on a sofa like a man of wood, without a hinge or a joint in him
she added, dropping her voice suddenly, looking at him earnestly, and seeming in a moment to forget the object of her wrath
giving him her little finger
said Edith, with a stately bend
said Mr Carker, bowing low
cried Mrs Skewton, who had taken this opportunity of inspecting Mr Carker through her glass, and satisfying herself (as she lisped audibly to the Major) that he was all heart
said Mr Dombey, with cumbrous gallantry
cried the Major, bursting into speech at sight of the waiter, who was come to announce breakfast
said the lady-mother, at breakfast, after another approving survey of him through her glass
cried Mrs Skewton, with a faded little scream of rapture
said Mr Dombey, with solemn encouragement of his Manager
said Mrs Skewton, half an hour after tea
said Edith, looking at her
she said, with flashing eyes
she continued, with her eyes fixed on her mother
said Florence to the excellent Nipper
said Florence, thoughtfully, and after musing for some moments
returned her maid, after considering
observed Susan, with composed forbearance
said the stricken Toots, always dreadfully disconcerted when the desire of his heart was gained, and he was speaking to her
said her host, as he conducted her to the carriage
returned the Nipper, softening more and more towards the house, as they approached it nearer
said her father, turning to the first, and holding out his hand
the good lady seemed curious on the subject of Princess's Place, and looked all round it as she spoke
said the mild Miss Tox
returned Mrs Chick, a little softened
said Mrs Chick, after sitting silent for some time, with her head on one side, and her parasol sketching on the floor
said Mrs Chick, with solemn patience
said Mrs Chick, in a lofty tone
said Mrs Chick, as if that consequence were highly probable
said Mrs Chick with ineffable disdain
she was more sharp and emphatic in that short clause than in any other part of her discourse
said Mrs Chick, shaking her head with energy, and arranging herself in her chair
said Mrs Chick, with majesty
said Mrs Chick, with sarcastic dignity
said Mrs Chick, addressing herself to the whole of the furniture, in a comprehensive glance of resignation and appeal
cried Mrs Chick, looking round the room with a prophetic smile
said Mrs Chick, with desperate sternness
said Mrs Chick, rising, not as if she were going to stop at the floor, but as if she were about to soar up, high, into her native skies
said Mrs Chick, with a shiver
said Mrs Chick, in a state of soliloquy
said Mr Chick slowly, after rubbing the bridge of his nose for some time with his newspaper
continued Edith, looking round to see that they were quite alone, and speaking in a lower voice
said Mrs Skewton, on the entrance of her daughter and her charge
said Mrs Skewton, in a lower voice, which conveyed her opinion that Florence was in a very unfinished state
said Mrs Skewton, detaining her hand
returned Cleopatra, with bewitching vivacity
said Mrs Skewton, giving him her hand
her mother almost shrieked in her passion, while her palsied head shook like a leaf
said Edith, ashy pale, and pointing to the window
says the Major, putting out both hands
and here he hits himself hard upon the breast
says the Major, seeing this
says Mr Dombey, with a gratified air
concludes the Major, with great firmness
says the Major, with appropriate action
with a strange glance at his patron
says the Major, putting down his coffee-cup, and looking at his watch
Cousin Feenix says -- good-natured creature, Cousin Feenix
says he in a low voice
said Mr Carker, with a servile stooping of his neck, which the revelations making by his eyes and teeth proclaim to be a lie
repeats Cousin Feenix, feeling that it is a neat point which will bear repetition
resumes Cousin Feenix in a graver tone, as if he had suddenly become a sadder and wiser man
cried the Captain eyeing him sternly
the gentleman went on to say in the same breath
said Mr Toots, looking up In the Captain's face as he sat down in a chair by the fire, which the Captain placed for him
said the Captain, dropping his voice
said Mr Toots, in a forlorn whisper
said Mr Toots, as the discovery flashed upon him
repeated Mr Toots, with a startled glance at the Captain
cried Mr Toots, whose tender heart was moved by the Captain's unexpected distress
said the Captain, looking at the fire
said the Captain, gazing at the fire
said the Captain, shaking his head slowly
cried Mr Toots, blurting out his words through a singular combination of awkward chuckles and emotion
the burst with which this confession forced itself out of the unhappy Mr Toots, bespoke the vehemence of his feelings
said Mr Toots, with energy
said Mr Carker, taking up his usual position before the fireplace, and keeping on his hat
said the Captain, in the goodness of his nature
returned the Manager, with all possible politeness
rejoined the Manager, stretching forth his arm
said the Manager, shaking his forefinger at him, and showing him all his teeth, but still amiably smiling
said the good-humoured Manager, gathering up his skirts, and standing astride upon the hearth-rug
pursued Carker, with the easy and vivacious frankness of a man of the world who knew the world too well to be ruffled by any discovery of misdoing, when it did not immediately concern himself
gasped the Captain, in a choked and trembling voice, and with a curious action going on in the ponderous fist
returned the Manager, with the same frankness
he replied, shaking his head mournfully
he added, laying his hand gently on her arm, for an instant
she returned, after a moment's silence
said Harriet, looking full upon her visitor, and changing her manner on the instant -- not that it was less composed and quiet, but that there was a deep impassioned earnestness in it that made the very tremble in her voice a part of her firmness
said the gentleman, rubbing his forehead again; and drumming on the table as before
Very business-like indeed, Mr What's-your-name
he said, resuming his chair
said the visitor, with careful delicacy
said the gentleman, rubbing his head, as despondently as before
said the gentleman, checking himself impatiently
referring to the little porch
she said, lifting her head suddenly
said the daughter, with a laugh, and looking down at herself in terrible derision of herself
she pursued, glancing timidly at the attentive and stem face opposed to her
said the old woman, hobbling to the cupboard
diving down into her pocket, and jingling a few half -- pence on the table
she replied, attiring herself, with fumbling fingers
squeezing her own tarnished halfpence up to her bag of a throat
croaked the old woman, coming back a step or two
said the old woman, stretching out her neck with a leer of malice absolutely frightful
cried the old woman, shaking her head and laughing; for her daughter had started up
and when it has gone round the table, adds persuasively
cried Mrs Skewton, rallying her dear child, who now entered
addressing her after a moment's silence, with especial distinctness
cried Florence, clinging to her as for help, and hiding her face upon her bosom
said Florence, with the same mute appeal, and the same quick concealment of her face as before
replied the bold mild man
said Cousin Feenix, addressing the table with a smile, and a gay shake of his head
with a pleasant sense of the readiness of this joke
said Mrs Chick to Mr Chick
said Mrs Chick with candour
retorted Mrs Chick, with great severity
said Mrs Chick, swelling with indignation
she repeated, bending her disdainful, steady gaze upon him
said Mr Carker, stepping forward
said Mr Dombey, in his most stately manner
with a nod of dismissal
repeated Edith, in so imperious a tone that Withers, going to the door, imperiously informed the servant who was waiting
said Mrs Skewton in her mildest manner; for her daughter's face was threatening
hinted Cleopatra in a low voice, as she held her eye-glass aside
said Mr Carker, appealing to Mrs Skewton with a look of grateful deference
said Carker, turning his white teeth on Mrs Skewton like a light
said Edith, flashing her disdainful glance upon him
said Mr Toodle, with a young Toodle on each knee, and two more making tea for him, and plenty more scattered about -- Mr Toodle was never out of children, but always kept a good supply on hand
said Mr Toodle, relishing his meal infinitely
observed Mr Toodle in his slow and measured way, and shovelling in his bread and butter with a clasp knife, as if he were stoking himself
said Rob, dutifully kissing her
cried Rob, resorting to his coat-cuff in anguish of spirit
cried Miss Tox, looking at Rob
said Mr Toodle, with a touch of poetry in his tone
said Miss Tox, arrived at her own door
blurted out Mr Toots, one day all at once, as his manner was
replied the Captain, who had at length concluded on a course of action
observed the Captain, nodding his head thoughtfully
said Mr Toots, gesticulating violently with the hand in which he held his hat
said Mr Toots, holding back his extended hand for a moment
said the Captain, whose opinion of Mr Toots was much improved by this candid avowal
cried the tender Rob, injured and indignant in a moment
said the Captain, in explanation to the young lady at the bar
said the Captain, grasping him by the hand
replied the voice within Bunsby, unaccompanied by any sign on the part of the Commander himself
said the Captain, rendering irrepressible homage to his genius
said Captain Cuttle, sorrowfully meditating
the Captain involuntarily looked round, and shook his head
the Captain shook his head again
said the Captain, appealing to him solemnly
returned Bunsby, with unusual promptitude
said Captain Cuttle, who would seem to have estimated the value of his distinguished friend's opinions in proportion to the immensity of the difficulty he experienced in making anything out of them
said the Captain, quite confounded by admiration
Mrs MacStinger used the last word for the joint sake of alliteration and aggravation, rather than for the expression of any idea
cried Mrs MacStinger, with a lengthening out of the last syllable that made the unfortunate Captain regard himself as the meanest of men
said Mrs MacStinger, with sudden rapidity
said Mrs MacStinger, with a sharp stress on the first syllable of the Captain's name
repeated Mrs MacStinger, in the same determined manner
said the Commander, getting off the chest, and opening the lid
said Mr Dombey, with his most offensive air of state
said Mr Dombey, in a tone of sovereign command
said Mr Dombey, with magisterial importance
said Mr Dombey, who, after the emotion he had just seen, set great store by this means of reducing his proud wife, and who was perhaps sufficiently willing to exhibit his power to that gentleman in a new and triumphant aspect
he continued, after a few moments, during which, in his increasing haughtiness, he had improved on his idea
he thought, rising in his moral magnificence, and rising a stiffer and more impenetrable man than ever
she said, with a slight motion of her hand before her brow, which did not for a moment flinch from its immovable and otherwise expressionless gaze
raising the hand she pressed upon her bosom, and heavily returning it
he fancied he saw tears glistening in her eyes, and he thought, complacently, that he had forced them from her, though none fell on her cheek, and she regarded him as steadily as ever
said Mr Dombey, rising as he spoke
she cut some of her words short, and cut out others altogether
returned Mr Dombey, loudly and laboriously
said the Major, with his hands behind him, and his legs very wide asunder
returned Mr Dombey, with much philosophy
said the Major, taking in another button of his buff waistcoat
croaked the old woman to Mrs Skewton
muttered her shadow, looking after her
says Doctor Blimber to Cornelia
and saying of Miss Dombey
with a shriek and a stare
says Cousin Feenix, stroking his chin, which he has just enough of hand below his wristbands to do
to which Mr Dombey answers
said Mr Carker, glancing at his bundle
said Mr Dombey, in his lofty patronage
returned Carker, with an air of disparagement
observed Mr Dombey; very sensible, as he said so, that he was paying him a handsome and flattering compliment
said Mr Dombey, after a little hesitation
said Mr Dombey, passing this compliment with august self-denial
he went on to say
said Mr Dombey, with majestic coldness and indifference
said Mr Dombey, in his tone of state
said Mr Dombey, in a gentlemanly toleration of the dead
said Mr Dombey, checking the unusual emotion with which he had spoken, and falling into a tone more like that in which he was accustomed to assert his greatness
said Carker, after a silence, suddenly resuming his chair, and drawing it opposite to Mr Dombey's
he continued with a smile, and softly laying his velvet hand, as a cat might have laid its sheathed claws, on Mr Dombey's arm
said Mr Dombey, with haughty reserve, and yet with some embarrassment
returned the Nipper, much exasperated
said Florence, who was sitting thoughtfully at her table
said Edith in a low voice
she remarked, in a threatening manner, to herself, that morning, with many twitches of her head
said Susan Nipper, with her usual rapidity
and here the black-eyed shook her head, and slightly stamped her foot
cried Susan Nipper, bursting into tears
cried Susan Nipper, in a final burst
returned Mrs Pipchin, with vengeance in her hard grey eye
said Mr Dombey, turning back towards the fire
snapping her up particularly short
said Susan, looking back at Mr Dombey, 'that I have told a piece of truth this day which ought to have been told long before and can't be told too often or too plain and that no amount of Pipchinses -- I hope the number of 'em mayn't be great' (here Mrs Pipchin uttered a very sharp
said Towlinson, outside the door with the boxes, addressing Florence
said Mr Toots, as an additional recommendation
said Carker, in a low voice
said Edith, when the door was closed
said Mr Carker, sitting down in a chair that was near her, with an air of the most profound and most considerate respect
he repeated those words slowly and with great emphasis
oh how distinct and plain and emphasized this was
said Carker, after a pause
he said after a little hesitation; meantime they had been, and still were, regarding each other as before
he said, in a low voice
he answered, in his voiceless manner of assent: adding aloud
she said, in a low voice
muttered the old woman, watching her daughter with her red eyes
said the Grinder, producing his concluding remark as if it were the climax of all his injuries
cried the old woman, appealing to her daughter
returned Rob, appearing to wish that his readiness had carried him to any other place
returned Rob, with the same distrustful glance at the packer's and the bottle-maker's, and the church
said Mrs Brown, with her arms uplifted towards the sky, and her head thrown back and shaking
she said, with her eager avaricious face
said the Manager, with a smile
said the Manager, with unusual irascibility
said the Manager, with the snarl of a tiger-cat
snapping his thumb and finger
said his brother, whose roused feelings had soon yielded to surprise
said Florence, stealing softly to her side
answered Edith, taking the hand that embraced her neck, and looking into the eyes that looked into hers so lovingly, as Florence knelt upon the ground before her
said Edith, after a pause
pursued Mr Dombey, with an indifferent assumption of not having heard her
said Mr Dombey, still going majestically on, as if she had not spoken
cried Mr Dombey, striking his hand upon the table
said Mr Dombey, resuming the thread of his discourse
returned his wife, immoveable in eye, and voice, and attitude
she repeated, exactly as before
pointing at Carker, who still listened, with his eyes cast down
pointing to Florence with a hand that slightly trembled for the first and only time
said Mr Dombey, with an angry flush of triumph
for he turned sharply when she said so
said Mr Dombey, resuming as much as he could of his arrogant composure
said Mr Dombey, speaking with knitted brows, and after a moment's consideration
said Edith, immoveable in voice, in look, and bearing, as she had been throughout
said Edith, addressing her proud face to Carker
said her husband, with supreme amazement
the light in his eyes fell upon her as he separated his words each from each, with the distinctness of so many bells
said Carker, with an unusual and indefinable taunt in his air
shrinking back, as Florence moved a step towards her
said the Captain, as a quotation
said the Captain, polishing the bridge of his nose with his arm until it shone like burnished copper
replied the Captain, leading the way into the parlour
said Mr Toots with a chuckle
said the Captain to Mr Toots, with not a little shame and hesitation
said the Captain, knocking at the door
cried Florence, hurrying to him
murmured the Captain, looking at her drooping face
said the Captain, after sitting for some time silently rubbing his chin, with his eyes fixed upon her
he bestowed a most significant look on Florence, accompanied with pantomime, expressive of sagacity and mystery -- to have the goodness to
said Florence, when she came out with a parcel, the size of which greatly disappointed the Captain, who had expected to see a porter following with a bale of goods
returned the baffled Captain, looking straight down the street before them
said the Captain, tremulously wiping his head
returned the Captain, supporting her with his hand
said the Captain, still looking in the same direction
said Walter, softly, as if he were thinking aloud
was the Captain's invariable reply to any solicitation of the kind
said Walter, musing, when they stood resting from their labours at the shop-door, looking down the old familiar street; it being still early in the morning
taking the paper from his pocket, which had been opened in the presence of the enlightened Bunsby
Walter's voice was indistinct and husky here, and he looked away, along the street
inquired the Captain, wistfully eyeing him as he pondered and pondered
said the Captain, turning his eyes upon him with a faint approach to a severe expression
replied Walter, grasping his hand
hinted the Captain, with some revival of his discomfiture
said the Captain, drooping more and more
said Walter, starting a fresh point with a gayer air, to cheer the Captain up -- but nothing could do that; he was too much concerned
said Mr Toots, rushing into the parlour without any ceremony
said Mr Toots, holding his forehead
returned the Captain, taking him by the hand
said Mr Toots, stopping short, on second thoughts, and taking away his hand
said Mr Toots, warming as he became better acquainted with Walter's face and figure
said Mr Toots, with great excitement
said Mr Toots, who had arrived at that appellation by a process peculiar to himself; probably by jumbling up his Christian name with the seafaring profession, and supposing some relationship between him and the Captain, which would extend, as a matter of course, to their titles
cried Mr Toots, starting from his chair and shaking hands with him anew
said Mr Toots, appealing to him
said Walter, not at all slow in returning his greeting
said Mr Toots, with severe self-accusation
said Mr Toots, touching her proffered hand, with a pang of hopeless love visibly shooting through him, and flashing out in his face
said that gentleman, stopping near the bottom of the stairs, and turning round
said Mr Toots, standing in the passage, behind the half-opened door
said Florence, looking at him earnestly, but with a changing face
cried the Captain, suddenly elated
murmurs his sister, sidling into the room, on the day of Florence's departure
rejoins his sister, with her handkerchief to her face, and shaking her head
says the Major, in the warmth of friendship
proceeds the Major, with a wag of his head
says the Major, very blue, indeed, and grasping his cane in the middle
says the Major, with the horse's cough
says Mrs Pipchin, in her snappish way
says Mrs Pipchin; she still calls Miss Tox Lucretia, on account of having made her first experiments in the child-quelling line of business on that lady, when an unfortunate and weazen little girl of tender years
says Miss Tox, who, in her instruction of the Toodle family, has acquired an admonitorial tone, and a habit of improving passing occasions
at which each shuddered from head to foot, and said
said Mr Dombey to the old witch who was chuckling and leering close at his elbow, and who, when he turned to address her, pointed stealthily at her daughter, and rubbed her hands, and pointed again
with a disdainful glance about him
he said, after a moment's pause, during which he had observed her, sternly
chuckled the old woman, shaking her head, and rubbing her shrivelled hands
returned Mr Dombey, apparently relieved, and assured by this inquiry
said Good Mrs Brown, crooking her ten fingers
he said, when the bent figure of Mrs Brown came back, shaking its head and chattering to itself
said the unfortunate youth, greatly aggravated
said Rob, pulling his hair with both hands in the exasperation of his feelings
said the Grinder, glancing at Alice, who sat with her eyes fixed, as it seemed to him, on the wall behind him, but in reality on Mr Dombey's face at the door
mused the Grinder with a dejected face
pleaded Rob, coming a little out of his corner
she interposed, in her stern voice, and with an impatient action of her head
retorted the old woman quickly
she returned, repeating her secret signal
said Mr Perch, confidentially looking in at the room door, and stopping on the mat to wipe his shoes all round, which had no mud upon them
Mr Perch went on to say, with a shake of his head
said Mr Perch, shaking his head and speaking in a silvery murmur
said Mr Perch, with an affable smile
and how Mr John Carker had said, in an awful voice
said John Carker, reading the letter
she laid her hand hastily upon his lips
quietly sitting by his side
said his sister, with the slightest and most transient glow upon her cheek
said her brother, who had listened with close attention
said her brother, lighting in their late visitor, and speaking in a low voice
said the visitor, coming in -- for he had stopped a moment in the doorway
to let him know that I was within hearing,' said Mr Morfin
said her brother in a low voice
said the visitor, dropping his voice
he replied, shaking her hand
said Alice, kneeling down beside her
returned the other, with a proud, fierce look
said Alice, with the same grasp of her arm, and the same look in her face
a bald man, with a large beard from a neighbouring restaurant
he at length repeated, putting down the lamp, and smiling his most courtly smile
said Carker, with a smile
said Edith, bending her darkest glance upon him
she said, surveying him with a haughty contempt and disgust, that he shrunk under, let him brave it as he would
she said, confronting him steadfastly
he said, showing all his teeth
said Edith, pointing at him
she replied, uprearing her proud form as if she would have crushed him
cried the driver, looking over his shoulder
to a horse who shook his bells
he asked the man who had waited on hIm over-night, now entering with a candle
cried the Nipper, running into Florence's room
pursued Susan, with another close embrace and burst of tears
here Susan burst into a violent hysterical laugh
pursued the Nipper, with her usual volubility
returned Florence, giving him both her hands, with all her innocent gratitude beaming in her face
said Mr Toots, in an awful voice
said Mr Toots, taking out his pocket-handkerchief
said Mr Toots, in an impassioned tone
said the Captain, in his hoarse whisper, and tapping Mr Toots on the chest with the back of his hand, and falling from him with a look of infinite admiration
returned the spirited Mr Toots
continued Mr Toots with watery eyes
cried Susan, bursting out afresh, and shaking her head violently
and here she laid her light hand on his shoulder, and looked into his face
or growling some remonstrance to
returned Mr Toots, with much solemnity
said Mr Toots, after hesitating for a strong expression
said the Captain to Diogenes
said the Captain, looking thoughtfully at his cards, and stroking his chin with his hook
said the Captain, looking round with an exultation to which even his face could hardly render justice
said the Captain, impressively, and announcing a quotation with his hook
said Toots, hitting on that name in the inspiration of a bright idea
resumed the Instrument-maker, taking his old spectacles from his pocket, and putting them on his forehead in his old manner
glancing at the downcast eyes of Florence, and not attempting to finish the sentence
returned the Captain, after staring at him and the rest for a long time, without speaking
repeated the Captain, to make his declaration the more solemn and impressive
said the Captain, as if he were putting the most improbable case in the world
returned Uncle Sol, beating time with the forefinger of his right hand upon the palm of his left, with a steadiness and distinctness that might have done honour, even to the infallible chronometer in his pocket
said the Captain, staring round in the last state of discomfiture
said the Captain, shaking his head
said Walter, on parting with him at the house door
replied Mr Toots, quite touched
said the Chicken, doggedly, when he, at length, caught Mr Toots's eye
returned the Chicken, putting on his hat
coughs Mrs Miff whose cough is drier than the hay in any hassock in her charge
says Mr Sownds with a relish
and how Mr Dombey had replied
and with that had struck his hand upon his forehead, and said
he said, with a disappointed air
said Harriet, casting down her eyes upon her black dress
she went on to say
said Mr Morfin, after a silence
said the visitor's mild voice
said Alice, shrinking with her face behind her hand
said Alice, taking the hand again, and fixing her lustrous eyes lovingly upon her visitor, while she merely addressed a motion of her finger to the old woman
answered Alice, faintly and solemnly
repeated the old woman, menacing the vacant air with her shrivelled fist
as if she were in passionate contention with some unseen opponent at the bedside, who contradicted her
stretching out her arm to Harriet, across the bed
said the old woman, touching the face of her daughter fearfully, and withdrawing her hand
said Harriet, when she shut the book
resumes Mrs Chick, quite regardless of Mrs Pipchin's observations
says the discreet lady, with an argumentative air
said Miss Tox, winding up a host of recollections
he departed from the usual course, and said
said Mr Feeder, shaking his hands
said Mr Toots, stretching out his hand towards his wife
said Mr Toots, looking abruptly out of the windows
said Mr Toots, apart to Mrs Blimber
said Mr Toots with a delighted face
said Mrs Toots, raising herself quickly from the sofa, very pale
said Mrs MacStinger, 'if you would wish to heal up past animosities, and to see the last of your friend, my
said Mrs MacStinger, turning round to the more intrepid of the two
said the Captain, nudging him with his elbow
said Mr Toots, stepping forward
said Mr Toots, who had spoken with great feeling and high admiration
said Florence, looking mournfully upon her
said Florence very gently, and drawing nearer to her
cried Florence, falling on her bosom
said Cousin Feenix, ambling in at the door, and speaking, half in the room, and half out of it
resumed Cousin Feenix, still ambling about at the door
said Cousin Feenix, with a real and genuine earnestness shining through the levity of his manner and his slipshod speech
she said in a low voice
said Cousin Feenix, lifting his wristbands to his eyes in the simplest manner possible, and without the least concealment
says Mr Toots, with great earnestness
resumes Mr Toots, after some contemplative pulling at his pipe, during which his visage has expressed the most contented reflection
