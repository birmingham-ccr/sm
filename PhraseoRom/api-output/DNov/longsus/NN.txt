rejoined Mr Nickleby, who was a slow and time-taking speaker
said Mr Nickleby, putting the repeater back in his pocket
said the gentleman, taking off a white hat which was so full of papers that it would scarcely stick upon his head
said Mr Nickleby, calling up a charitable look
muttered Mr Nickleby to himself, as he walked on
said Ralph, walking in without more parley
said Miss La Creevy with another cough
said Miss La Creevy, rubbing her hands
added Miss La Creevy, who was plainly wavering between her good-nature and her interest
said Ralph, turning to the door, for these encomiums on poverty irritated him
said Mr Nickleby, making off with great speed
said the girl, throwing open the door
growled Ralph, with an ill-favoured frown
said Nicholas, flushed with anger
muttered Ralph, walking up and down the room
said Mr Ralph Nickleby, checking himself
said Nicholas, starting gaily up, and wringing his uncle's hand
said the waiter, looking in at this juncture
said Squeers, taking up a pen
interrupted Ralph, checking the torrent of recommendation
said Squeers, perplexed with such an application from a youth of Nicholas's figure
said Nicholas, addressing Mr Squeers
said Ralph, producing a small parcel
said Nicholas, presenting his hand
said the good-natured miniature painter
said that gentleman, smacking his lips
pursued Mr Squeers, putting the mug before the children
said Squeers, calmly getting on with his breakfast
said the schoolmaster, dividing the bread and butter for three into as many portions as there were children
said Squeers, jumping up and producing a little basket from under the seat
said Squeers, coming up at the moment buttoning his greatcoat
whispered Kate, touching her brother's arm
said Squeers, explaining to the stranger
said Squeers, in great haste
said the gentleman, glancing at the card
said the gentleman, glancing at Nicholas with a half-smile, and a more than half expression of surprise
cried Nicholas, staggering to his feet
said Squeers, insinuating himself into the warmest corner
said the merry-faced gentleman, who did not seem to approve very much of the patronising tone adopted by Squeers
replied the lady with strong emotion
said the merry-faced gentleman, looking merrier still
said the good-tempered gentleman when they had been all sitting round the fire, for some time, in silence
said he of the good-tempered face
said Squeers, rubbing his hands
remarked his wife as the door closed
said the lady, opening the cupboard
observed Squeers in a soothing manner
said Squeers, interrupting the progress of some thoughts to this effect in the mind of his usher
said the schoolmaster as they stepped in together
said Squeers, giving the desk a great rap with his cane, which made half the little boys nearly jump out of their boots
resumed Squeers, turning to the boy
continued Squeers, turning over his papers
said Squeers, looking very grim
said Squeers, tucking up his wristbands, and moistening the palm of his right hand to get a good grip of the cane
said Squeers, when he had quite done
said Squeers, when he had possessed himself of the contents
said Squeers, folding it up
said Squeers, after a terrible pause, during which he had moistened the palm of his right hand again
replied the youth, drawing closer to his questioner's side
said Squeers, drawing up his chair
said Squeers, spelling the name according to some eccentric system which prevailed in his own mind
said Squeers, in answer to the above remark
said Nicholas, pointing to the pen, and smiling, in spite of himself, at the affected embarrassment of the schoolmaster's daughter
said Miss Squeers, colouring up to the top row of curls
said Mr Browdie, laughing boisterously
replied Mr Browdie, 'but t'oother teacher, 'cod he wur a learn
said Nicholas in a towering passion
shrieked Miss Price, stopping her admirer's mouth as he was about to interrupt
said the corn-factor, bestowing a hearty kiss on Miss Matilda; 'let 'un gang on, let
said Miss Price, beckoning him aside, and speaking with some degree of contempt
said Miss Price -- smiling a little though, for she was pretty, and a coquette too in her small way, and Nicholas was good-looking, and she supposed him the property of somebody else, which were all reasons why she should be gratified to think she had made an impression on him
said Miss Squeers, looking slyly at Nicholas
said the Yorkshireman, striking the table heavily with his fist
exclaimed Miss Squeers with dignity
thought Nicholas, when he had groped his way to the dark sleeping-room
said Miss La Creevy, sinking her voice to a confidential whisper
said Miss La Creevy, after a long silence, to wit, an interval of full a minute and a half
replied Kate, speaking more gently
continued Kate, whose tears fell while she spoke
said Miss La Creevy, with a very sprightly air
said Ralph, hastily striking in
he said, taking her arm
said the young lady, after they had hurried on in silence for some time
replied Ralph, stopping her short
said Kate, when she judged they must be near their destination
said Ralph, walking faster, in the impatience provoked by the remark
said Ralph, who had looked on, at all this, with such scorn as few men can express in looks
said Ralph when they got into the street
said Mrs Nickleby, trying to be pleased
said Kate hesitating, and remarking Newman's averted face
said Phoebe, for which name 'Phib' was used as a patronising abbreviation
rejoined Miss Squeers, with a stately air
shrieked Miss Squeers, in her shrillest tone
cried Miss Price, affecting alarm at her friend's threat, but really actuated by a malicious wish to hear what Nicholas would say
said Miss Price: her bright eye dancing with merriment as she saw the perplexity of Nicholas
said Nicholas, as the brown bonnet went down on his shoulder again
stammered Nicholas with a half- smile, and looking towards Miss Squeers
said the blushing Miss Squeers in soft accents
said the irritated young lady, when she had regained her own room, and eased her mind by committing an assault on Phib
said Nicholas, in an agitated voice
replied Nicholas, shaking his head mournfully
replied Nicholas, pursuing the train of his own thoughts
replied Nicholas, with the same humane intention
said Squeers, evidently frightened, though he endeavoured to look otherwise
said Squeers, catching the little boy suddenly by the arms and whisking up his drapery in a most dexterous manner
said Squeers, his usual harsh crafty manner changed to open bullying
laughed Mrs Squeers, 'that's a good
exclaimed Mrs Squeers, taking Smike's head under her arm, and administering a cuff at every epithet
said Nicholas, flushed with passion
he said, frankly, after a moment's pause
said Nicholas, turning scarlet as he spoke
said Nicholas, not very well knowing how to make the avowal
interposed John Browdie, in a tone of compassion; for he was a giant in strength and stature, and Nicholas, very likely, in his eyes, seemed a mere dwarf
replied the honest countryman, reining in his impatient horse
added the poor creature, drawing his rags together
said Mrs Kenwigs, turning to the other married lady
Mr Kenwigs was going to say
said Kenwigs, addressing the collector
said Mr Lillyvick, surveying his audience with a grave air
cried her mother, at this crisis, much affected
replied Crowl, who was not best pleased at the prospect of losing his fire
said Newman, passing his hand hastily over the coat which Nicholas had thrown off
replied Newman, with his accustomed taciturnity
said Nicholas, after a few moments' reflection
said Newman, speaking for the moment, in his earnestness, like any other man
said Mr Lillyvick, in a loud voice
said Crowl, looking in at this happy juncture
said Crowl, who had been listening at Newman's door with all his might and main
I should feel just the same, if I was her
said Nicholas, returning to Mrs Kenwigs
exclaimed Mrs Kenwigs, addressing young Lillyvick's deliverer
said the collector, with a dubious shrug of his shoulders
observed Mr Lillyvick, as a great concession
said Mr Gregsbury, tossing a great bundle of papers into a wicker basket at his feet, and throwing himself back in his chair with his arms over the elbows
said Mr Gregsbury, looking towards the speaker
said Mr Gregsbury, looking round upon the deputation with gracious magnanimity
said Mr Pugstyles, with a distant bow
said Nicholas, with a half-smile
said Nicholas, after a moment's reflection
observed Mrs Kenwigs in making the proposition
cried Nicholas, with great alacrity
said Mrs Kenwigs, drawing herself up
said Mr Lillyvick, shaking his head mournfully
replied the man, holding the door in his hand, and honouring the inquirer with a stare and a broad grin
replied Kate, laying aside her bonnet
said Miss Knag, as Kate was taking her weary way homewards on the first night of her novitiate
rejoined Miss Knag most complacently
observed Madame Mantalini, glancing with affected carelessness at her assistant, and laughing heartily in her sleeve
cried Miss Knag with a countenance beaming delight
said Miss Knag, glancing at the reflection of herself in a mirror at no great distance
said Miss Knag, bestowing a kiss upon Kate at the conclusion of the second day's work
answered Kate, correcting herself hastily, for she was afraid of appearing proud
rejoined Miss Knag with that sort of half-sigh, which, accompanied by two or three slight nods of the head, is pity's small change in general society
said Miss Knag, smiling sweetly as she spoke
said poor Mrs Nickleby, brightening up
said Mrs Nickleby slowly, as if she were making a tremendous effort to recollect something of paramount importance
said Miss Knag, nodding in great triumph
said the lord's intended, throwing herself languidly on a sofa
said the young lady, in the same careless manner
said the lively lady, poking the peer with her parasol
said Kate, stepping hastily forward
cried Miss Knag, coming, all at once, bolt upright, to the great consternation of the assembled maidens
cried Kate, almost paralysed by the violence with which the adjective had been jerked out from between Miss Knag's closed teeth
continued Miss Knag, getting off the box, and introducing Kate with much ceremony and many low curtseys to the delighted throng
exclaimed Miss Knag, sobbing in a most affecting manner
said Miss Knag, stamping first her right foot and then her left with remarkable energy
cried Mrs Nickleby, flying off at another angle
said Mrs Nickleby, with great fervour
said Ralph, with a smile, which, in common with all other tokens of emotion, seemed to skulk under his face, rather than play boldly over it
said Kate, a little flurried, as people much more conversant with society often are, when they are about to enter a room full of strangers, and have had time to think of it previously
said Sir Mulberry Hawk, in a thick coarse voice
laughed the honourable Mr Snobb
replied Lord Frederick, fixing his eyes on Miss Nickleby
said Lord Frederick, sipping his first glass of port
said Kate, looking hastily up
said Sir Mulberry, folding his crushed hat to lay his elbow on, and bringing himself still closer to the young lady
said Kate, trembling in spite of herself, but speaking with great indignation
pursued Ralph, speaking slowly and firmly, as a man who has made up his mind to say no more
said Miss Knag, when the message had been delivered, with many ornaments of speech
he said, after a short silence
answered Nicholas, with a more sprightly air
said Ralph, folding up Miss Squeers's note
said Ralph, speaking in a very marked manner, and looking furtively, but fixedly, at Kate
said Ralph, after a long silence, broken only by Mrs Nickleby's sobs
said Nicholas, looking eagerly round
said Ralph, appealing to the mother again
cried Kate, throwing herself on her brother's shoulder
he said, wringing her hand
he said, in a voice inaudible beyond themselves
said Nicholas, as cheerfully as he could speak
said Smike, shaking his head mournfully
said the lad, laying his hand timidly on that of Nicholas
said Nicholas, grasping him heartily by the shoulder
said Miss Knag, as the satellites flocked round, to relieve her of her bonnet and shawl
said Madame Mantalini, when Kate presented herself
rejoined Mr Tix, placing the marks of his four fingers, and a duplicate impression of his thumb, on a piece of sky-blue silk
said Mr Scaley, producing a small document from his pocket and unfolding it very slowly
said the same gentleman, after a pause
said Mantalini, approaching his wife with a penitent air
cried Madame Mantalini, when this sound met her ear
cried his wife, flinging her arms about him
remarked Mrs Nickleby (who, it is scarcely necessary to observe, had never said so before
exclaimed Mrs Nickleby, laying the paper down in triumph
said Kate, after a few seconds of awkward silence
said her husband, addressing himself to Mrs Nickleby
he thought, suddenly correcting himself
rejoined Nicholas, laying his hand upon his shoulder
resumed Smike; his eyes sparkling at the prospect of displaying his abilities
replied his companion, with a vacant look
repeated Nicholas, with assumed carelessness
said the poor creature, shaking his head
rejoined the youth, with a melancholy look
thought Nicholas, as he looked into the void
said the manager, leaning over to Nicholas, and sinking his voice
said Nicholas, with a half-smile
exclaimed the manager, quite horrified
said the manager, striking his knee emphatically
replied Nicholas, hardly less surprised
said the manager (for Nicholas had given the name which Newman Noggs had bestowed upon him in his conversation with Mrs Kenwigs
said the lady, crossing to Smike, as tragic actresses cross when they obey a stage direction
said Mr Vincent Crummles, bringing the maiden forward
said the actor, setting his teeth together, and drawing in his breath with a hissing sound
replied Mr Folair, beating his slippers together, to knock the dust out
said this gentleman, making a thrust at his friend, who parried it dexterously with his slipper
said Miss Snevellicci, sidling towards Nicholas
said Mr Vincent Crummles, who had been writing on a piece of paper
repeated Mr Crummles, raising his voice, to drown the unfortunate Mr Johnson's remonstrance
said Nicholas, taking the manager aside
said Mrs Crummles, in the same charnel-house voice
replied Mr Crummles, shaking his head
said Nicholas, with an air of very strong objection
said Nicholas, moved by these appeals
said the tailor's daughter, after a short period of absence, during which the clinking in the back-room had ceased, and been succeeded by whispering
rejoined Nicholas, laying his hand upon the scrapbook
said Mrs Curdle, entering the parlour
said Nicholas, hesitating between the respect he ought to assume, and his love of the whimsical
said Mr Curdle, turning to the phenomenon
said Miss Snevellicci, taking his arm
said good- natured Mrs Borum, turning again to Miss Snevellicci
retorted Mr Crummles, rolling up the bills again
added Mr Crummles with a prophetic sigh
said Mr Crummles, drawing a little nearer, and speaking in the tone of confidential friendship
said Mr Lillyvick, snapping his fingers
retorted the collector, patting him benignantly on the side of the head with his umbrella
said the collector, highly anxious to prevent any misunderstanding on this point
said the collector, with a rueful face
said Mr Crummles, deeming it a matter of decency to be affected by this allusion to himself and partner
said Sir Mulberry, pausing with a morsel on the point of his fork
replied Sir Mulberry, shrugging his shoulders and manifesting an indifference, whether he felt it or not
said his client, throwing himself along the sofa on which he had been previously seated, so as to bring his lips nearer to the old man's ear
said Ralph, rubbing his hands slowly over each other
said Ralph, with feigned reluctance
said Mrs Nickleby, acknowledging the compliment with a graceful bend
said Mrs Nickleby to herself
cried Mrs Nickleby, hastily arranging her cap and front
said Mr Pluck, looking round
said Mrs Nickleby, and the poor lady exulted in the idea that she was marvellously sly
muttered Mr Pluck, after a short pause
said Pyke, as if suddenly recollecting himself
said that excellent gentleman, lowering his voice
cried Mr Pyke, falling into his chair with a miniature in his hand
repeated Sir Mulberry, looking round to his companions
said Pyke, imitating the baronet's action, and turning the lie over to his friend
said Mr Wititterly, rubbing his hands
said Mrs Wititterly, with a faint smile
said Mrs Wititterly, after a long silence
said Mrs Nickleby, who had been listening in silence
added Mrs Nickleby, in a whisper to Mrs Wititterly
said Kate, scarcely knowing, in the tumult of her passions, what she said
exclaimed Sir Mulberry, as though quietly communing with himself; passing his arm round her waist as he spoke
said Mr Pluck, saluting both ladies with the utmost cordiality
observed Sir Mulberry, turning round
added Mr Wititterly, wheeling round to the nobleman
said Mrs Wititterly, with some violence
said Mrs Wititterly, with a sudden burst of spite
said Mrs Wititterly (this, by the way, must have been some little time before
cried Kate, looking upwards and clasping her hands
he said, looking round with an air of melancholy triumph
said Ralph, relaxing into a smile
said Kate, hurrying to the old man, and laying her arm upon his shoulder
said Kate, bending over him, and timidly placing her little hand in his
said Ralph, poising himself alternately on his toes and heels, and looking coolly in his niece's face
rejoined Ralph, raising his forefinger
interrupted Kate, with becoming pride and indignation
said Ralph, scowling round, and shaking his clenched hand as the faces of the two profligates rose up before his mind
rejoined Nicholas, with assumed gaiety, for the confession would have made the boy miserable all night
said Nicholas, taking up the tall hat and tossing it towards the door
remonstrated Mr Folair, suddenly losing all his dignity
returned Mr Folair, waving his hand in deprecation of any further wrath
said Mr Folair, stopping to make a calculation in his mind
replied Mr Folair, scratching his head
said Nicholas, looking quietly round
said Nicholas, nodding his head
said Nicholas when the first piece was over, and he had almost finished dressing to go home
said Nicholas, casting his eye upon the cramped direction
said Mrs Crummles, who was seated there in full regal costume, with the phenomenon as the Maiden in her maternal arms
rejoined the manager, scratching his head with an air of some vexation
resumed Miss Snevellicci, after a short silence
rejoined the actor, contemplating the effect of his face in a lamp reflector
rejoined the immovable Mr Folair
said Mr Folair, with undisturbed calmness
added Nicholas, as Smike approached
returned Miss Ledrook, with considerable vivacity
whispered the collector, drawing him aside
said Mr Snevellicci, looking round the table
replied Mr Lillyvick, pointing to his astonished wife
said Mr Crummles, shaking his fist at the comic countryman when he came off
said Mr Crummles, looking wistfully towards the point at which he had just disappeared
cried Nicholas, struggling in the manager's arms
said Newman, throwing some intelligence into his eyes all at once, and dropping them on his master
cried Miss La Creevy, starting as Newman bolted in
said Miss La Creevy, rising to receive Newman, who met her half-way
said the miniature painter, brightening up and clapping her hands
said Miss La Creevy, wiping her eyes after a short pause, and cramming her handkerchief into her pocket with great bustle and dispatch
cried Newman, dashing his cherished hat on the floor
said Newman, picking up his hat
said Miss La Creevy, as a wind-up to all her expressions of anger
said Miss La Creevy, earnestly
said Nicholas, looking round and scarcely able to make his white lips form the words
cried Sir Mulberry, as the man was retiring
said Sir Mulberry, throwing Nicholas's card towards him
cried Nicholas, clenching his fist and suddenly changing his tone and manner
said Mr Wititterly, with the gravity of a man on the right side
here he was interrupted by a violent fit of coughing
said Mrs Nickleby, crying bitterly
returned Mrs Nickleby, with a petulance not unnatural in her unhappy circumstances
said Madame Mantalini, addressing herself to Ralph, who leant against his easy-chair with his hands behind him, and regarded the amiable couple with a smile of the supremest and most unmitigated contempt
said Madame Mantalini, wiping her eyes
said Madame Mantalini, as tokens of impatience manifested themselves in Ralph's countenance
said Madame Mantalini, looking at Ralph, and prudently abstaining from the slightest glance at her husband, lest his many graces should induce her to falter in her resolution
observed Ralph with a sneer
exclaimed Mr Mantalini, opening his eyes at the sound of Ralph's voice
answered Ralph with great composure
said Mr Mantalini, taking Ralph by the button
said Ralph, hesitating a little
replied Mr Mantalini, in an admiring tone
muttered Ralph, dropping into his chair
said Ralph, bending his gaze upon the visitor, and half smiling as he scrutinised him attentively
remarked Squeers, a little disconcerted
said Squeers, with a triumphant air, as Master Wackford wiped his eyes with the cuff of his jacket
replied the proprietor of Dotheboys
said Squeers, heaving a sigh, and nodding his head a great many times
said Squeers, touching first the roots of his hair, and then the toes of his boots
replied Squeers, who seemed to know the man he had to deal with, too well to suppose that any blinking of the question would induce him to subscribe towards the expenses
replied Squeers, scratching his head
added Squeers, moving in his chair with the impatience of an ill-used man
added Squeers, closing the door on Master Wackford
returned Squeers, briskly, as if he felt relieved by the suggestion
returned Squeers, rubbing his knees
said Squeers, dropping his voice, and drawing his chair still closer to Ralph
replied Newman, suddenly thrusting his face into that of Squeers
pursued Ralph, with a bitter smile
thought Nicholas as he departed on his benevolent errand
said Smike, overjoyed to see his friend again
replied Smike, pressing his hand
said Nicholas, entering the room where his sister sat alone
said Mrs Nickleby, shrinking back
added Mrs Nickleby, turning round with an air of less reserve than she had before assumed
said Nicholas, shaking his head
replied the fat clerk, turning his spectacle- glasses towards his principal, and his eyes towards Nicholas
said Mr Cheeryble, tapping with his knuckles, and stooping to listen
replied a voice from the inside, so like in its tones to that which had just spoken, that Nicholas started, and almost thought it was the same
said Nicholas's friend, closing the room-door
said Tim, making a calculation in the air with his pen, and drawing an imaginary line before he cast it up
added Tim, sinking his voice a little
replied brother Ned, nodding his head as a man thoroughly determined
said Mr Kenwigs, arranging his shirt-collar, and walking slowly upstairs
said Mr Kenwigs, half aside
said Mr Kenwigs, as though he pitied him from his heart
said Mr Kenwigs, taking his second daughter on his knee
said Mr Kenwigs, abruptly, and raising his voice as he spoke
said Mr Kenwigs, taking a pinch of snuff from the doctor's box, and then sneezing very hard, for he wasn't used to it
said Mr Kenwigs, dropping his voice
said Mr Kenwigs, standing opposite the door so as to get the earliest glimpse of the visitor, as he came upstairs
said Mr Kenwigs, looking around with a plaintive air
said one of the married ladies
said Mr Kenwigs, reverting to his calamity
said Tim, clapping Nicholas on the back
said Tim, extending his forefinger towards Nicholas
said the other, seizing Tim's disengaged fist
returned the other old fellow
said brother Ned, first examining the cork and afterwards filling his glass, while the old butler looked complacently and amiably on, as if it were all his own property, but the company were quite welcome to make free with it
said brother Ned, filling a corresponding number of glasses with the double-diamond
said Mrs Nickleby, wiping her eyes
said Mrs Nickleby, drying her tears
added Mrs Nickleby, correcting, herself
replied Mrs Nickleby in a very serious tone
returned his mother in a peevish tone
exclaimed Mrs Nickleby, with a half- simper
added Mrs Nickleby, after a momentary pause
replied Mrs Nickleby, tossing her head and looking at the ashes in the grate
added Mrs Nickleby, with increased confusion
thought Mrs Nickleby, communing with herself in her own room
murmured Mrs Nickleby, peering into the garden
returned Miss La Creevy, anticipating the close of the sentence
said Miss La Creevy, pausing to consider
returned her little friend, with a gravity very unusual in her
said Miss La Creevy, relapsing into the cheerful, chattering tone, which was habitual to her
as Miss La Creevy protested
said the invalid, turning his head impatiently towards the adjoining room
cried Sir Mulberry, calling the man back, as he passed his hand over his disfigured face
said Sir Mulberry, motioning him to the chair by the couch side, and waving his hand in assumed carelessness
said Ralph, speaking more slowly, and with harsher emphasis
said Ralph, wilfully mistaking the meaning of the interruption
said the invalid, actually striking at his broken leg in the ecstasy of his passion
said Ralph, after a short term of silence, during which he had eyed the sufferer keenly
said Ralph, raising his eyes
said Ralph, his face darkening, and his own hatred getting the upper hand of him, for the first time, as this gay picture of Nicholas presented itself
said Mr Squeers, patting his son's head
said Mr Squeers, when he had satisfied himself upon this point
said John, when a hackney coach had been called, and the ladies and the luggage hurried in
said John Browdie; 'we dean't come to Lunnun to do nought but
muttered John, looking into the empty dish as the waiter retired
said Mr Squeers in a moralising way
said Squeers, turning to his daughter
replied Squeers, staggering in his chair under the congratulatory blow on the chest which the stout Yorkshireman dealt him
observed Squeers, when he had finished, looking very cunning
cried Tim, with a contemptuous emphasis
cried brother Charles in violent agitation
replied his brother, hurrying into the room
said Tim, taking his pen out of his mouth
cried Nicholas, grasping his hand
cried Nicholas, in high wrath
said Nicholas, in a discontented whisper
said Mrs Nickleby, gravely shaking her head
observed Mrs Nickleby, as she took her seat
added Mrs Nickleby, looking narrowly about her
said Kate, bending over her work so that her face was almost hidden
said Kate, raising her face again
said Mrs Nickleby, beginning with her left thumb and checking off the names on her fingers
returned Mrs Nickleby, considerably startled
said Mrs Nickleby, laying her hand on Kate's
replied Mrs Nickleby, looking towards the garden-wall
rejoined Mrs Nickleby, drawing herself up, and patting her daughter's hand more blandly than before
cried Kate, really terrified for the moment
returned her mother, still holding back
replied the stranger, folding his hands together
said the old gentleman, coming up a step higher, and leaning his elbows on the wall, with as much complacency as if he were looking out of window
he added, dropping his voice almost to a whisper
replied Mrs Nickleby, in the same tone of voice
said the old gentleman, laying his finger on his nose, with an air of familiarity, most reprehensible
here he kissed his hand and bowed again
observed Mrs Nickleby, turning to her daughter
inquired the old gentleman with great anxiety
returned Mrs Nickleby, with some warmth
said Mrs Nickleby, drawing herself up
said the old gentleman, flourishing his right hand negligently, as if he made very light of such matters, and speaking very fast
he looked towards his house and spoke very low
said Mrs Nickleby, fixing her eyes modestly on the ground
resumed Mrs Nickleby, with perfect seriousness
said the man on the other side
rejoined the man, taking his handkerchief out of his hat and wiping his face
said John, rather astounded for the moment
said John, with a broad grin
says she -- and she coom a deal closer and squeedged a deal harder than she'd deane afore
rejoined John Browdie, drawing up his chair
said John, wiping his eyes; 'a very bad
observed Mrs Browdie, looking very sly
said Mrs Browdie, with her archest smile
cried a shrill female voice
continued Miss Squeers, who, being excited, aspirated her h's strongly
said Miss Squeers, tossing her head, and looking contemptuously at the floor
rejoined Mrs Browdie, disregarding all the endeavours of her spouse to restrain her, and forcing herself into a front row
interposed John Browdie, nettled by these accumulated attacks on his wife
said Miss Squeers, taking him up very quickly
said Miss Squeers, looking sideways at her parent
retorted Miss Squeers with a low curtsy
returned Miss Squeers, with laborious politeness
said Miss Squeers, with such a sudden accession of violence that John started in his boots
cried Miss Squeers in a solemn voice
said John, 'noo my blood is oop, that thou'rt an old ra'ascal; and that it's weel for thou, thou be'est an old
said Squeers, turning round and addressing Nicholas, who, as he had caused him to smart pretty soundly on a former occasion, purposely abstained from taking any part in the discussion
said one of the men from the yard
said the young man, who had certainly not quite recovered from his recent heat
replied the young lady, tossing her head
said the young man, looking with an air of admiration in the barmaid's face
thought Nicholas, coming to the real point in his mind
added Tim, taking off his spectacles, and smiling as with gentle pride
said Tim, folding his arms resolutely
said Tim, tapping the forefinger of his left hand emphatically with his spectacles
said Charles, after he had patted Tim Linkinwater approvingly on the back
said brother Charles, calling him aside, and taking him kindly by the hand
returned Mrs Nickleby, in a severe manner
said Mrs Nickleby, rubbing her nose with an impassioned air
said Kate, stealing her arm round her mother's neck
said Kate, in great agitation
rejoined Ralph, drawing his spencer on
said the man, bluntly, after a brief pause, during which he had seemed to struggle with an inclination to answer him by some reproach
rejoined Ralph, folding his arms
resumed the other more humbly
said the man, in a suppressed voice
said the man, with a strange mixture of humility and sense of power
said Ralph, in his harshest accents
said Ralph, menacing him with his hand
muttered Ralph, drawing his hand across his mouth with a connoisseur-like air, and surveying the house from top to bottom
said Ralph, catching her by the wrist
continued Madame Mantalini, drying her eyes, and speaking with great indignation
retorted Madame Mantalini, tossing her head
said Mr Mantalini in tears
said Noggs, stopping for breath
added Mrs Nickleby, after a short consideration
said Kate, addressing his young wife
said Ralph, 'by your tongue; and HIM' (pointing to Smike
cried Nicholas, burning with fury
said Ralph, looking round with a biting and triumphant smile, and gloating and dwelling upon the words as if he were loath to lose the pleasure of saying them
he continued, bending eagerly forward, and addressing Nicholas, as he marked the change of his countenance
said Nicholas, looking quietly away
said Ralph, with a gruff expression of sympathy
said Ralph, producing one from his coat
whispered Kate, who had been looking anxiously over his shoulder
said Ralph, addressing himself to Mrs Nickleby
said Nicholas to the other two
cried Mr Squeers, through the keyhole
said Snawley, addressing the terrified Smike
said Ralph, lingering for a moment
said the old gentleman, tapping his desk emphatically
said brother Charles, with sparkling eyes
said brother Charles, in a gentle voice
said Nicholas, who felt so embarrassed that he had no small difficulty in saying anything at all
said Nicholas, as he took the piece of paper
rejoined Nicholas, his lips trembling as he formed the words
said Nicholas, with respectful earnestness
muttered Newman Noggs, listening to the chimes of some neighbouring church
replied Ralph, looking coldly down upon him
said Arthur Gride, after looking out at the door and carefully reclosing it
said Ralph, rendered very irritable by old Arthur's pausing again
said Ralph, shrugging his shoulders
returned old Arthur, with a chuckle
said Ralph, hastily substituting for this argument considerations more nearly allied to earth
returned Ralph, who thoroughly knew his man, and had taken his ground accordingly
rejoined Ralph, as mildly as his nature would allow him
said Ralph, sitting down beside him
this was said in a lower tone
said her father, gently disengaging himself
added Mr Bray, addressing Arthur Gride
said Ralph, turning to his companion
said Mrs Crummles, thrusting forward the Phenomenon in a blue gauze frock, extensively flounced, and trousers of the same
said Nicholas, shaking his head, and making an attempt to smile
cried Mrs Nickleby, with her wonted suddenness
she added, in a more gentle tone
said Mrs Nickleby, deliberately sitting herself down in a chair with that sort of desperate resignation which seemed to imply that now matters had come to a crisis, and all disguise was useless
continued Mrs Nickleby, drying her eyes
interposed Mrs Nickleby with severe dignity
continued Mrs Nickleby, drawing herself up, and looking another way with a kind of bashful stateliness
said the old gentleman, raising his voice
said the worthy lady, with a prefatory cough
here Mrs Nickleby simpered and hesitated
murmured Mrs Nickleby, reviving when the coast was clear
said Nicholas, drawing his sister towards him and kissing her
said Nicholas, tapping gently at his door
inquired Nicholas, in his kindest manner
said the friend, affecting to speak in a whisper
interrupted Sir Mulberry, turning suddenly round
said the other, shrugging his shoulders
muttered Sir Mulberry with an oath
cried Sir Mulberry, in a thick hoarse voice
said the young lord, looking hurriedly about him, and addressing one of those who had interposed
replied the captain, referring to his watch
said the captain, when he had communicated the arrangements
said Arthur Gride, appalled by the mention of the word
muttered Arthur; adding with an ugly leer
he said, laying his hand on Newman's
replied Gride, arresting his hand
muttered Ralph, as he tore it to pieces
cried Nicholas, with honest enthusiasm
said Newman, looking after him
replied Morleena, also in tears
who was the daughter of the ambitious neighbour
returned Miss Morleena, with the energy of both her parents combined
said Mr Lillyvick, turning humbly to his niece
said the poor collector meekly
said Mr Lillyvick, looking sternly round
said Mr Lillyvick, when a heart-rending scene had ensued and the children were cleared away again
said Mr Kenwigs, with one hand round Mrs Kenwigs's waist: his other hand supporting his pipe (which made him wink and cough very much, for he was no smoker): and his eyes on Morleena, who sat upon her uncle's knee
said Bray, wheeling his chair round and confronting Nicholas
said Bray, tossing the paper back again, with an exulting smile
he continued, after a short silence
said Madeline, with momentary firmness
said Nicholas, in an agony of supplication
said Nicholas, with the same violent rapidity with which she spoke
returned Arthur, with a groan
cried Arthur Gride, shading his eyes with his hand
thought Arthur Glide, as he glanced at Nicholas, and trembled with passion at his boldness and audacity
replied Gride, drawing in his head with a frightful grin
muttered Arthur, fastening as he spoke
said Ralph, suffering his lip to curl into a smile
said Ralph, speaking, in spite of himself, in a low and subdued voice
returned Ralph, looking at his watch
he said, stamping his foot impatiently upon the ground
said Nicholas in a low deep voice
said Ralph, turning upon Kate again
said Nicholas, taking up a position before the door, and speaking in the same low voice in which he had spoken before, and with no more outward passion than he had before displayed
cried Nicholas, letting loose all the passion he had restrained till now
said Nicholas, extending his disengaged hand in the air
said Ralph, in a voice scarcely intelligible
so the good lady argued
Mrs Nickleby would say, coming into the room with an elaborate caution, calculated to discompose the nerves of an invalid rather more than the entry of a horse-soldier at full gallop
said Nicholas, after a little reflection
cried Nicholas eagerly, as he looked from the coach window
resumed Mr Squeers, rubbing his knees
said Squeers, fidgeting in his chair
returned Squeers, almost overpowered by the determination which Ralph displayed to make everything tell against him, and by his stern unyielding manner
said Ralph, in no way abashed by the reminder
said Ralph, leaning forward, and placing his hand on Squeers's arm
Mr Squeers delivered himself of this epithet with great difficulty and effort
muttered Squeers, looking as amiable as he possibly could the while; for Peg's eye was upon him, and she was chuckling fearfully, as though in delight at having made a choice repartee
said Squeers, accompanying his remarks with appropriate action
said Mr Squeers, deriving fresh facetiousness from the bottle
said Peg, shaking her head
she cried, folding her arms and wagging her head
cried Peg, with a malicious relish of her old master's defeat, which made her natural hideousness something quite fearful
he added, handing her the glass
replied Squeers, affecting to be out of humour
bawled Squeers, as she rose to fetch them
said Peg, kneeling down on the floor beside him, and staying his impatient hand
he said, as he strove to compose him
said Smike, in a low voice, and glancing fearfully round
replied the woman, abashed by his harshness
returned brother Charles, shaking his head
retorted Ralph with a triumphant smile
exclaimed the old merchant warmly
said Ralph, passing quietly by
said Ralph, suppressing his passion as well as he could, and clutching her tightly by the wrist
replied the woman, violently disengaging herself
said Tim, getting off his stool with great agility
said Ralph with a curl of the lip
said Charles and Ned together
cried Newman, thrusting him aside, and moving his hand as Tim moved, so as to keep him at arm's length
said the old gentleman, laying his hand upon his brother's shoulder
sighed Squeers, who, between the brandy and water and his broken head, wandered strangely
added Mr Squeers, with deeper gravity
cried Tim, catching him by the arm and speaking most earnestly
said Ralph, as his eyes brightened
said Ralph, pointing with his finger towards the recess already mentioned
said Mrs Nickleby, wiping her eyes, and sobbing bitterly
she said, in a trembling voice
she added, her momentary composure forsaking her
repeated Nicholas, with a mournful smile
thought Nicholas proudly, while on his way, soon afterwards, to the brothers' house
said Tim, standing in his favourite attitude and pointing to the cage with the feather of his pen
returned Tim, wiping his eyes
replied Mr Cheeryble, who, in the midst of all his comforting, was quite as much taken aback as honest old Tim
said Nicholas, with some natural hesitation
said the old man, after a short silence
returned Nicholas, meeting his eye
he said, after Nicholas had paused for some time
said Mrs Nickleby, when they had rendered becoming honour to the bidding, and Tim had taken his departure
rejoined that lady, with a face of unfathomable mystery
replied Mrs Nickleby, in a lofty manner
cried brother Charles, utterly forgetting his assumed dignity
said brother Charles, who was always spokesman
cried the little woman with all her heart
said Mrs Nickleby, taking her daughter aside, as soon as they got upstairs
cried the woman, stamping on the ground
said Mr Mantalini, dropping the handle of the mangle, and folding his palms together
he cried, in a suffocating voice
said Miss Squeers, hot and flushed from the recent encounter, but vixenish to the last
