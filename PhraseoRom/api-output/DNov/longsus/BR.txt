again he glanced in the same direction as before
replied Joe, contriving in the course of some arrangements about the hearth, to advance close to his questioner and pluck him by the sleeve
said the young fellow fretfully
said Joe, adding in an undertone as he approached him again
observed Mr Willet, blowing a long, thin, spiral cloud of smoke out of the corner of his mouth, and staring at it abstractedly as it floated away
said John Willet, turning his eyes from the ceiling to the face of his interrupter, and uttering the monosyllable in capitals, to apprise him that he had put in his oar, as the vulgar say, with unbecoming and irreverent haste
added John, putting his pipe in his mouth again
said the strange man, gruffly
returned the landlord, a little brought down from his dignity by the stranger's surliness
said Solomon Daisy, dropping his voice and appealing to the post-office keeper
said the clerk, bending forward
said Solomon, turning his back upon the strange man
said the man who had been the cause of the narration
returned the traveller, snatching it from his hand
cried the old man in the chaise
said Varden, descending nimbly from his chaise
he said when he had scanned his features
said Solomon, winding up a variety of speculations relative to the stranger, concerning whom Gabriel had compared notes with the company, and so raised a grave discussion
he said, as they stood without, in the porch, and the locksmith was equipping himself for his journey home
said Joe -- finding, however, something very engrossing to do in the way of strapping and buckling
said Joe after some hesitation
said the locksmith, after a hasty but careful inspection
returned the locksmith, shaking his head, and smiling
said Sim, looking up with amazing politeness, and a peculiar little bow cut short off at the neck
muttered Gabriel, 'that's out of the 'Prentice's Garland or the 'Prentice's Delight, or the
said the locksmith's daughter, when this salute was over, and they took their seats at table
he added, turning to his daughter
said Dolly, turning alternately very red and very white, which is no doubt the effect of a slight scald
said Mr Tappertit, dashing it down again
he added, looking under the table and about the floor
exclaimed the woman, clasping him
returned the locksmith with some irritation
she answered, rising as she spoke
she said in a low voice
said the locksmith, softening under this soothing process, and stopping to smile
and here was the vexation
cried Barnaby, glancing over his shoulder
said the locksmith, with a grave look
said Barnaby, passing his arm through Varden's, and peering close into his face as he answered in a whisper
he added, with some hesitation
he said, in answer to the locksmith's sympathising look
returned the locksmith, accommodating his action to his speech, and bending over him
said Varden, dropping his voice still lower
he added, shaking the locksmith by the hand
said Gabriel, bending down yet more, and looking cautiously towards their silent neighhour
returned the locksmith, following his look towards Barnaby
said Edward, as he shook him by the hand, and looked from him to Mrs Rudge and back again
said the locksmith, who most devoutly wished that Barnaby's raven was at Miggs's ankles
cried Miggs, with a flushed face
cried Mrs Varden, bursting into tears
added Mrs Varden, with more resignation
said Mrs V.-- not scolding, but in a sort of monotonous remonstrance
urged the locksmith, endeavouring to look as wakeful as possible
thought Varden, shrugging his shoulders and drawing his chair nearer to the fire
murmured Gabriel, waking at the noise, and looking round the room
replied Mr Tappertit haughtily, descending as he spoke
said Mr Tappertit, with a gloomy majesty
replied the other, stretching himself -- and he was so long already that it was quite alarming to see him do it
said Mr Tappertit, eyeing the host over as he walked to a closet, and took out a bottle and glass as carelessly as if he had been in full possession of his sight
cried the host, smiting them reproachfully
said the novice, 'that's not the worst -- he calls his
said the novice, who was an ill-looking, one- sided, shambling lad, with sunken eyes set close together in his head
thought Mr Tappertit, musing among the nine-pins
pursued Mr Tappertit, not exactly in a voice of thunder, for his tones, to say the truth were rather cracked and shrill -- but very impressively, notwithstanding
said Mr Tappertit, letting his gaze fall on the party indicated, who was indeed the new knight, by this time restored to his own apparel
said Mr Tappertit, scrutinising it attentively, while a breathless silence reigned around; for he had constructed secret door-keys for the whole society, and perhaps owed something of his influence to that mean and trivial circumstance -- on such slight accidents do even men of mind depend
rejoined Mr Tappertit, catching him by the wrist, and giving him a look which would have been expressive of the most deadly malevolence, but for an accidental hiccup that rather interfered with it
whispered the blind man as he held it open for his passage out
cried Miggs, rubbing her hands
said Miggs, wrapping herself in a shawl, and drawing a couple of chairs near the window, flouncing down upon one, and putting her feet upon the other
said Miggs, more faintly than before
and it is impossible to describe the use he made of his eyes when he said this
said Miss Miggs, recovering as soon as she was left alone
returned John with a readiness quite surprising
returned the other with a smile
said the guest when he had written a few lines
said the guest, glancing on what he had written, and folding it
said John after a long pause
said the guest, raising his eyes to John's fat face
said John, frowning aside at Barnaby
said the guest, who had by this time sealed the note, and who beckoned his messenger towards him as he spoke
said Barnaby, folding the little packet in his breast
said Mr Willet, very slowly, and after a long silence
John added this in confidence
said Barnaby, chinking it in his hand
said John, taking it out again after a time, and pointing at him with the stem
said Mr Willet, not at all grateful for the compliment
said Mr Willet, arriving at his logical conclusion
said Solomon Daisy, who had exhibited some impatience at the intrusion of so unworthy a subject on their more interesting theme
Mr Parkes, who had a large nose, rubbed it, and looked as if he considered this a personal allusion
said Solomon, looking from face to face
said this gentleman, without the least appearance of embarrassment or reserve
returned the other, waving his hand
returned the other, leaning his arm upon the chimney-piece, and turning a haughty look upon the occupant of the easy-chair
said Mr Chester, tapping his snuff-box, and following with a smile the impatient gesture he had made -- perhaps unconsciously -- towards his sword
returned the other, most composedly
returned the other, tasting his wine with great deliberation
he returned, sipping his wine
said the other, not at all disturbed
returned the other, rocking himself to and fro as in assent, and nodding at the fire
said Mr Haredale, who had been pacing to and fro
rejoined Mr Chester with the utmost blandness
he added in a lower tone
returned the other, sipping his wine
said Mr Haredale, after a short silence, during which he had eyed his smiling face from time to time intently
said Mr Haredale, moving to and fro, and stopping, and moving on again, like one who was ill at ease
returned John, taking up a candle, and nudging Barnaby and Hugh to accompany them, in case the gentleman should unexpectedly drop down faint or dead from some internal wound
added Mr Willet, after he had stared at him for a little time, in a species of stupefaction
said Mr Willet, surveying him from top to toe
said Gabriel, dropping his voice, and shaking his head
said Mrs Varden with great emphasis
returned Miggs, with shrill rapidity
retorted her mistress, looking round with dignity
said Mrs Varden, glancing at herself in a neighbouring mirror, and arranging the ribbon of her cap in a more becoming fashion
said Miggs, confident in the strength of her compliment, and developing strongly in the throat as usual
said Joe after a short silence
said Mr Chester, glancing at this last- named person as he set down his teacup and plied the golden toothpick
said Edward, bringing a chair forward, and seating himself near the table
returned his father, crossing his legs
said the son, with an air of great concern
Edward resumed, when he had complied with this request
said the young man, stopping at length before him
interrupted his father with a compassionate smile
returned his father, taking a pinch of snuff and pushing his box towards him
returned his father, laying down the newspaper at which he had been glancing carelessly, and throwing himself back in the window-seat
said the father rising, and walking slowly to and fro -- stopping now and then to glance at himself in the mirror, or survey a picture through his glass, with the air of a connoisseur
returned the son, raising his head for a moment, and then falling into his former attitude
returned his father more compassionately than ever
cried the fellow, urged on by the looks of his comrades, and slapping him on the shoulder
replied the other, shaking him roughly off
and here he swore a tremendous oath
he rejoined, seating himself at the table
said Barnaby, turning almost quickly enough to catch the retreating form and closing door
said Barnaby, laying aside his hat and stick, and returning to the chair from which he had risen
said Barnaby, holding up his finger
said Barnaby, looking at her steadfastly as she sat down beside him after doing so
he returned between his teeth, as he motioned her aside
said Mr Tappertit, releasing his leg
said the blind man, preparing to descend
muttered Stagg, yielding to the other, who, pressing on him, had already gained a footing on the steps
said Edward, glancing at Dolly
said Mrs Varden, frowning at her husband
said the lady with a kind of solemn titter
interposed his wife with a Christian smile
said Gabriel, putting himself in the way as she was moving off with the aid of Dolly's shoulder
cried the locksmith, plucking at his wig in a kind of frenzy
said Mrs Varden faintly, and with symptoms of approaching incoherence
cried Miggs, turning on the tears again, previous to quitting the room in great emotion
said John to the cook
said Mr Haredale after a short silence, during which a smile, as he regarded her, had struggled through the gloom and melancholy that was natural to his face
answered Dolly, not sure but he was bantering her
he rejoined, endeavouring to draw her arm through his
returned Joe, who was in a state of great valour and bustle
said Hugh, looking at her keenly
said poor Joe; adding under his breath, with a very unfilial apostrophe
said Miggs, in a tone of commiseration
said the locksmith, when they reached the parlour
said Mr Tappertit, jumping off the counter on which he was seated
said Mr Tappertit, flourishing his bread-and- cheese knife in the air
he said, at length raising his eyes to the ceiling with the air of a man who was reflecting seriously on what he had read
he said, pressing his hand tenderly upon the book as he laid it down
replied the servant, who was to the full as cool and negligent in his way as his master
he said, handling his snuff-box
replied Hugh, striding in, followed by a dog, as rough and sullen as himself
returned the other, raising his head a little from the cushion and carelessly surveying him from top to toe
returned Hugh with increased embarrassment
said Mr Chester, glancing at the reflection of his anxious face
said Mr Chester, in the same easy tone, and smiling twice or thrice to try if the patch adhered
he added, as he tossed it down his hairy throat
said his patron, putting on his waistcoat with great nicety, and taking no heed of this request
he said, turning to Hugh
said his patron, with an air of the very kindest patronage
rejoined his patron, looking at him through his glass
he said, as he took a pinch of snuff
said Mr Tappertit with a low bow
said Mr Tappertit, laying his hand upon his breast
said Mr Tappertit, producing a small pocket-handkerchief and shaking it out of the folds
said Mr Tappertit, offering it with a graceful air
said Mr Tappertit, looking very hard at his nightcap
here a flush came over Mr Tappertit's face
said Mr Tappertit wildly, putting his hair up straighter, and making a crunching noise with his teeth
said Mr Chester, relaxing his face when he was fairly gone
said Mr Haredale, regarding her with some surprise
she rejoined with great earnestness
said the widow, breaking silence
she added in a low voice
John would say, if any unlucky stranger made inquiry touching the offensive vehicles
returned the locksmith with evident reluctance
said Mr Haredale, in a still lower tone of voice than he had spoken yet
cried the locksmith with brightened eyes, and sturdy, honest voice
said Mr Haredale, presenting himself before this new tenant
retorted the other in a suppressed tone and voice
he said, turning languidly to Mr Haredale
said Mr Haredale, sitting down
he said, as he walked along the street
he said, tapping the hilt of his weapon
he wisely added, as he took his seat
returned the 'prentice, laying down his hammer, and rubbing his nose on the back of a very sooty hand
said Sim, standing up to get nearer to his ear, and whispering hoarsely
returned Sim, eyeing him over with a look of concentrated expression
said Sim, looking into the door again, and adding this by way of postscript in his own person
said Mr Chester, advancing hat in hand, as he observed the effect of this last explanatory announcement
said Mr Chester in his softest tones
murmured Miggs as she sidled up to him
said Miggs, looking sideways at Mrs Varden, and interlarding her discourse with a sigh
this clause was strictly true
said Mr Chester, taking a pinch of snuff
he said, pressing her hand delicately to his lips
resumed her tempter with his most winning air
he answered, shrugging his shoulders meekly
she added aloud, and not unnaturally
said Mr Chester, not at all abashed
Mrs Varden coughed and simpered
said Mrs Varden, interposing with emotion
said Dolly, in a thoughtful manner
cried the enraged matron, bursting into tears
said Hugh, struggling into a sitting posture and gazing at him intently, still
said Mr Chester, as he put them on
said Hugh, disconcerted by this reproof, for he had expected high praise
returned his patron, putting it away after a moment's consideration
said Hugh, when he had tossed the liquor down
replied John with great importance
added Mr Willet, after an enormously long pause, during which he fixed his great dull eyes on Hugh, and waited with exemplary patience for any little property in the way of ideas that might come to him
retorted John, with quite an expression in his face
said John, relapsing into his usual stolid state
repeated Mr Willet, brushing his wig with his wrist, and inwardly resolving to distribute a small charge for dust and damage to that article of dress, through the various items of his guest's bill
he said, LOOKING a compliment to her beauty
she interposed with an altered manner and a firmer voice
said Mr Chester, looking upward, and apostrophising the air
said the good gentleman, with great emotion
said Mr Chester, leaning over her, and speaking in mild and quite venerable accents
said Mr Chester, bending over her more affectionately still
rejoined the other, resuming his accustomed manner with infinite readiness, and throwing himself upon the bench with a weary air
he said, raising his head to look after him
added John, collaring with one band, and aiding the effect of a farewell bow to the visitor with the other
thought Joe, as he threw his arms upon a table in the common room, and laid his head upon them
said John, after a long pause
assented Solomon Daisy with some approving nods
said Joe, looking up with a flushed face
cried Joe, smiting the table with his fist, so that the jugs and glasses rung again
here he cast an eye on Joe
replied the serjeant with an oath
said Joe, shaking hands with him
said Dolly -- with as pleasant a smile as if he were going into the next street, and were coming back to supper
said Joe, putting out both hands
said Mr Chester at length, with a most engaging laugh
interposed the parent hastily, as he set down his glass, and raised his eyebrows with a startled and horrified expression
said Mr Chester, raising his delicate hand imploringly
said Mr Chester, sipping his wine
returned his father, raising himself a little on the sofa, and looking straight towards him
he added, more earnestly though in a gentler tone
rejoined his father, turning his face lazily towards him, and cracking another nut
asked John, after a minute's contemplation
said Mr Willet, perfectly unmoved
said the little man, with an expression of face which bore ample testimony to the sincerity of his conviction
said Mr Willet after a long pause
said Mr Willet, eyeing the corners of the room in a manner which showed that, like some other philosophers, he was not quite easy in his theory
said John, looking timidly upward
returned John, elevating his eyebrows, and lowering his voice to the tone in which the question had been asked him
returned Mr Willet, glancing over his shoulder at the organ in question
he said, at the end of a long conversation
Hugh rejoined, holding the glass above his head, and fixing his eyes on Mr Haredale's face
he added in a subdued voice, as he turned to Hugh
rejoined Mr Willet, with a strong emphasis on the plural number
interposed the gentleman who had spoken before
said the speaker, rising in his stirrups
said the long-winded gentleman, in a tone of mild reproof
returned the person he appealed to, in a silky tone
here his lordship pulled off his hat again, though it was raining hard
said John Grueby, in a low voice
said John -- it is odd enough, but certain people seem to have as great a pleasure in pronouncing titles as their owners have in wearing them
said Gashford, filling his glass with great complacency
and here the secretary clasped his hands
he added, without waiting for an answer
said the secretary, looking sharply at the other's downcast eyes, which brightened slowly as he spoke
whined Gashford, drawing his chair nearer with an injured air, and laying his broad flat hand upon the table
he repeated, bending the dark hollows of his eyes upon him with an unwholesome smile
said John Grueby in his ear, after what appeared to him a moment of unconsciousness
exclaimed the secretary, drawing his sleeve in a hasty way across his eyes
said Lord George, biting his nails most horribly
rejoined the secretary, doing as he was told
he turned restlessly in his bed as he spoke
he said with a more restless motion than before
he cried, springing up in bed, after repeating the phrase 'unhappy country's sake' to himself, at least a dozen times
said Gashford in his ear, as he drew the curtains of his bed betimes
said Lord George, rubbing his eyes and looking round the room
growled John to somebody without
cried Dennis, with another roar
returned the man, thrusting his tongue into his cheek
said the fellow, laying his hat and stick upon the floor, and slowly beating the palm of one hand with the fingers of the other
replied Gashford, leaning back in his chair and yawning
repeated the secretary with some indignation
said the fellow, taking up his stick and shaking it with a ferocious air
and here he beat his club upon the ground
resumed Gashford, affecting not to hear the interruption
pursued the secretary, still smiling, and still managing his eyes so that he could watch him closely, and really not be seen in turn
said Gashford, opening his eyes to their utmost width
wheezed the hangman under his breath
he said, stretching out his hand and taking it back
whispered Dennis, with a horrible kind of admiration, such as that with which a cannibal might regard his intimate friend, when hungry
said Hugh, with a drunken flourish of his arm
said Dennis, looking round the room, when the echo of his boisterous voice bad died away
he began, with a thoughtful brow
said Mr Tappertit, looking round on the assembled guests
cried Hugh, beating his hat down on his head
rejoined the other, breathing on his fictitious nose, and polishing it with the cuff of his coat
he answered with a curious look
said Dennis, with a little hesitation
said Dennis, rubbing his legs
he said, taking it off, and whirling it round upon his fist
said Sir John after a pretty long silence
said Hugh, blurting the words out, after an embarrassed silence
returned Sir John, fixing his eyes upon him
cried Hugh, his passion rising, as the other meant it should
retorted Hugh, stopping in his passage out and looking back
he said, breaking into a smile
said her father, putting back the dark hair from her sparkling eyes
resumed the locksmith, pinching her cheek
cried Miggs with a great burst of tears -- for with her they never came on by degrees
said Mrs Varden, herself in tears
said the locksmith to Mrs Varden, who stood by with folded hands -- rather proud of her husband too -- while Miggs held his cap and sword at arm's length, as if mistrusting that the latter might run some one through the body of its own accord
resumed the locksmith, muttering to himself
pursued the locksmith, musing sorrowfully
said Gabriel, turning sharply to her
said the handmaid, stooping down to look into her face
cried the susceptible damsel, pressing her hand upon her side to quell the palpitation of her heart
he said under his breath
said Mr Haredale, after a minute's pause
said the locksmith after a pause
he said, turning to the locksmith with a gloomy smile
cried the other, detaining him
replied Sir John (for it was he
interposed Sir John at this juncture
retorted Mr Haredale, with a bitter glance at the third party in their conversation
said Mr Haredale, declining the proffer with a motion of his hand
replied Lord George in a loud voice, and waving his hand in a disturbed and agitated manner
he replied in the same manner as before
for the secretary had made a show of wishing to do so
said Mr Haredale, eyeing him from top to toe
said Gashford, upon whose unwholesome face the perspiration had broken out during this speech, in blotches of wet
another, in a stentorian voice
said a man, forcing his way between and pushing him towards the stairs with friendly violence
indeed they began to pour in as he said the words
said the secretary, with his worst expression of face, and in his mildest tones
and here he stopped and warmed his hands: then suddenly looked up
said the hangman, in his hoarest chuckle, as he pointed with his pipe to Hugh
he added in a whisper, as he drew his stool close to him and jogged him with his elbow
retorted Dennis, shaking his head, with a kind of pity for his friend's ingenuous youth
resumed the secretary, in a slow, impressive way
said Gashford, shaking him by the hand
said his mother, rising from her seat and laying her hand upon his shoulder
he answered, pointing with his staff towards the sun
returned the blind man with a sigh, and yet with something of a smile upon his face
he said, turning towards where Barnaby stood looking on
said the blind man, corking his bottle
said the widow, with a stifled groan
said the blind man, striking himself on the breast
he added, seeming to catch with his quick ear the very motion of her hand
said the blind man, calmly
said the blind man, thoughtfully
said Stagg, arising from the table
she said, in a half breathless manner
said the blind man, shaking his head
said the blind man, with a crafty look
said the gentleman angrily, as the man threw the gate wide open, and pulled off his hat
was Barnaby's timid answer, pointing to his mother
observed the gentleman, shaking his head
said the gentleman, rattling the money in his pockets
he roared to the widow
said Barnaby, as they were sitting next day in a waggon which was to take them within ten miles of the capital
said Barnaby, looking wistfully at her
and he pointed to where the House of Commons overlooked the river
implored the widow, laying both her hands upon his breast, and scarcely knowing what she did, or said, in the earnestness of her supplication
said Lord George, evading her touch, and colouring deeply
said Lord George, glancing at Barnaby, and whispering in his secretary's ear
and here he turned red again
he added, with a lip that slightly curled as he looked at Barnaby, who stood twirling his hat, and stealthily beckoning them to come away
said Lord George, addressing him
cried Lord George, pressing his secretary's arm tight within his own, and speaking with as much emotion in his voice, as in his altered face
he added, taking a flag from the hand of a tired man who tendered it
said Barnaby, looking anxiously round
cried Hugh with a grin
cried Barnaby with glistening eyes, as he clutched his pole the tighter
he added in a whisper, as he slipped to the other side of Dennis
said the other gentleman, addressing him in like manner
said Dennis, with an oath, as he rested his bludgeon in a corner with his hat upon it, and took his seat at the same table with them
said the hangman, in a tone of deep disgust
rejoined the hangman, calling after him
said the secretary, looking up with something between a snarl and a smile
returned Gashford, shrugging his shoulders
said Gashford, changing his manner for one of the utmost good fellowship and the pleasantest raillery
said the smooth secretary, whom Mr Dennis corroborated with sundry nods and muttered oaths
he said smoothly, as he stood among them with a great measure of liquor in his hand, and filled their glasses as quickly and as often as they chose
she added, turning to the locksmith's wife
replied Mr Tappertit, with a contemptuous look
returned his journeyman with great self-possession
said the locksmith, turning to his wife, and shaking his head sorrowfully, while a smile at the absurd figure beside him still played upon his open face
cried Mr Tappertit in a loud voice, which he suddenly dropped into a whisper as he repeated, with eyes fixed upon the locksmith
said the locksmith in a serious tone
he added, putting his hand into his waistcoat-pocket, and taking out a large tooth, at the sight of which both Miggs and Mrs Varden screamed
retorted Mr Tappertit, with a thickness and slowness of speech which contrasted forcibly with the rapidity and earnestness of his kind-hearted master
returned Mr Tappertit, after glancing at her with a smile of ineffable disdain
said Simon, turning to his master, with an utter disregard of Miggs's maidenly affliction
said his wife, with her handkerchief to her eyes
said Dennis, as, with a loud yawn, he raised his body from a heap of straw on which he had been sleeping, and supporting his head upon his hand, appealed to Hugh on Sunday morning
said Dennis, looking with great admiration at the uncombed head, matted beard, and torn hands and face of the wild figure before him
returned Hugh, shaking back his ragged hair and glancing towards the door of the stable in which they lay
said Hugh, crawling a little nearer to him
continued Hugh with another laugh
cried Mr Dennis, gaily shaking hands with him
he added, rolling back the straw, and pointing to where the ground was newly turned
said Gashford, pinching his arm with such malevolence that his nails seemed to meet in the skin
said the smiling secretary, in his smoothest voice, as he sat down cross-legged on a barrel
returned the hangman, staring at him
he added, with a muttered oath -- still staring at him in a thoughtful manner
he answered, scratching his head, and keeping his eyes upon the secretary's face
said the hangman in a low voice
said Hugh, wiping his face
resumed the secretary, after a moment's pause
returned Gashford, with an expressive smile
said Mr Willet, looking hard at Solomon Daisy -- for it was his custom in cases of personal altercation to fasten upon the smallest man in the party
said Mr Willet, putting his pipe in his mouth with an air of solemn disgust
returned the landlord, putting his into his pockets
answered Dennis, stepping towards him
and here he whispered in his ear
cried the man, grasping at his rein more tightly yet
he added, taking one from his own hat
said Solomon -- and the simple-hearted fellow cried outright, and wrung his hands
cried the little man, hastily
said John, looking about, as though he had lost his pocket-handkerchief, or some such slight article
said John, not at all regarding them
returned his angry master, glancing at himself
replied John, touching his hat respectfully
said the serjeant, with an imprecation on the rioters
he called out, half laughing and half weeping
said Simon, in a low voice
retorted his lieutenant, parting the men who stood between them, with his knife, that he might see him
said Dennis, cocking his hat for the convenience of scratching his head, and looking gravely at Hugh
said Sim, after a very awkward silence
said Simon, laying his hand upon his breast, 'not a
said Simon, as he smoothed his rumpled feathers
said Simon, who had now quite recovered his dignity
growled Dennis, as they walked away in company
said Hugh, looking round him
cried Hugh to those who kept the door
returned Mr Haredale, shaking his head
whimpered the old gentleman, as he wiped his forehead in a state of ludicrous distress
cried Mr Haredale, pressing the door open as the porter strove to shut it, and speaking rapidly
he added, putting up a pocket-book he had produced while speaking
said the blind man, after another pause
said the blind man, nodding his head with perfect composure
said his visitor, at length breaking silence
said the blind man, calmly
returned the blind man, with a cunning look
retorted Hugh, waving his comrades to be silent
cried Miggs, with additional shrillness
said the hangman, who particularly favoured the lamp-post suggestion
and here he emphasised his discourse with an oath
whispered Hugh, seizing Varden roughly by the shoulder
he said to Simon Tappertit
said Mr Tappertit, in a very unresponsive tone
said the locksmith, turning round upon them
interposed the locksmith, who felt that the tone in which this was said, conveyed the speaker's impression that he had ample excuse for yielding to the furious multitude who beset and hemmed him in, on every side, and among whom he stood, an old man, quite alone
said Mr Dennis, in a tone of mingled badinage and remonstrance
said the hangman, rapping at the door with his stick
said the hangman, pulling off his hat to take his handkerchief from the crown and wipe his face, and then putting it on again a little more on one side than before
said the hangman, in a low voice, as he stooped under pretence of doing what Hugh desired, but only looked up in his face
said the honest vintner, pulling him back
murmured Joe, as he dropped the flaring link upon the ground, crushed it with his foot, and gave his hand to Mr Haredale
he answered, putting away the hand which his son, with a timid desire to propitiate him, laid upon his sleeve
said his father, plucking the scraps of ribbon and the feathers from his hat
said Dennis, with a friendly smile
he added, in the tone of a desponding and an injured man
said Dennis, who remained untouched among them when they had seized their prisoners
he added, in a tone of resignation, addressing himself to Hugh
and then repeated what he had said before, namely
whispered Dennis, beckoning to her with his forefinger
cried Miggs, folding her hands and looking upwards with a kind of devout blankness
and here a shudder quite convulsed her frame
said Dennis, indicating Dolly by the slightest possible jerk of his head
said Emma, with some indignation
returned Miggs, with increased energy
said Emma, after a moment's pause
cried Dolly, pointing at him earnestly
said their visitor, who, although he sought to express the deepest interest, had something cold and even in his speech, that grated on the ear
said Emma, in a hurried manner
said Joe, who seemed to be the spokesman of the party, for all the rest were silent
said Mr Willet, senior, looking round upon the company
said the Black Lion, striking the table with his hand
sobbed the locksmith's little daughter
said Joe, in his homely way
said Barnaby, withdrawing his hand from the bird, and laying it upon his mother's arm, as he looked eagerly in her face
said Barnaby, as they heard the man approaching to close the cells for the night
she whispered in his ear
she added hastily as the key turned in the lock
she cried, clasping her hands, and looking upward
he said to the officers, who waited outside with the warrant for his arrest on a charge of High Treason
cried the hangman, as, following an officer, he traversed under these novel circumstances the remains of passages with which he was well acquainted
said the hangman, in a tone of greater confidence
said Hugh, contracting his brows
said Hugh, coiling himself into a new position
cried the hangman, whose features underwent a sudden change
growled Hugh, raising his head to look at him with a frown
he mused, dallying lazily with the teaspoon
said Sir John, leaning his head upon his hand, and sipping his chocolate
said Sir John, raising his hand in deprecation of his delivering any message
he added, when the door was opened
he added in his winning tone
he asked very sweetly, after a moment's pause
said Gabriel, with some pride in his manner
he added, with a glance at the man who stood looking on
returned the other, perfectly composed under this exordium
he dropped his voice and drew nearer to the bed
cried Sir John, hastily sitting up in bed
said Sir John Chester, confidentially, as he sipped his chocolate
said Sir John, setting down his cup, and laughing
said Gabriel, pointing to the one which lay by his side
said the locksmith, taking no notice of these compliments
observed Sir John with a slight yawn, though still with the utmost affability
