quoth she, and it will be observed that no emendation whatever is necessary to be made in these two initiative remarks
not fourth son, which is preposterous
said Mr Pecksniff, glancing round the table when he had finished
said Mr Pecksniff, laying the fore-finger of his left hand upon the brown paper patch on the top of his head
he was going to say
but recollecting that worms were not remarkable for heads of hair, he substituted
cried Mr Pecksniff after a pause, during which he seemed to have been casting about for a new moral, and not quite successfully
said Mr Pecksniff, after a short pause, during which he had been silently smiling, and shaking his head at the fire
cried Miss Mercy, holding up her hands with the most winning giggle in the world
said Mr Pecksniff, slowly and distinctly
said Mercy with her usual sprightliness
here the young lady shuddered
said Mr Pecksniff with his accustomed gentleness, though still with the air of one who suffered under injury without complaint
said Pecksniff, wheeling his chair about, and looking at him with an aspect of the deepest melancholy
cried Pinch, with great earnestness
said Mr Pecksniff, with the same serene upraising of his hand
he said, with a smile
said Pinch, in an undertone
said Mr Pecksniff, with a calmness quite ethereal
said the youth, turning towards him, with a hearty disgust of his late master
and here, although he spoke like one at peace with all the world, he used an emphasis that plainly said "I have my eye upon the rascal now
cried Mr Pecksniff, raising his voice, as Pinch appeared about to speak
said Mr Pecksniff, turning round again towards the fire, and waving his hand in the direction of the door
he said abruptly, after another lengthened silence
said Pinch with a sigh
said Pinch, pursuing his own thoughts and not this last remark on the part of his friend
cried Pinch, in a sort of desperation
said Mr Pinch, nursing one of his large knees, and nodding his head
and here, at every word, he struck him lightly on the breast
said Pinch, apostrophizing the coach
said the landlady of the Dragon
she resumed, after a short pause
she added, slightly smiling with a quick perception of what the landlady was going to add
returned the landlady, still more embarrassed than before
said the other mildly, but not without confusion on her own part
he added, leaning helplessly backward on his pillow
interposed the young lady, laying her hand upon his arm
cried the old man, moaning impatiently, as he tossed one restless arm upon the coverlet
she cried, advancing to receive him
asked Mr Pecksniff, drawing off his gloves and warming his hands before the fire, as benevolently as if they were somebody else's, not his
said the hostess, shaking her head
said Mrs Lupin, curtseying and blushing
said Mr Pecksniff, pausing at the door, and giving his head a melancholy roll
he said, lying down again, and turning away his face
said Mr Pecksniff, watchful of the effect he made
said Mr Pecksniff, keeping his hand in his waistcoat as though he were ready, on the shortest notice, to produce his heart for Martin Chuzzlewit's inspection
continued that gentleman, after another pause
said the old man, whose every feature darkened as he spoke
he added, with increasing bitterness
and here he looked closely in his cousin's eyes
continued Mr Pecksniff, drawing out his pocket-handkerchief, and winking with both eyes at once, as it were, against his will
added Mr Pecksniff, with great tenderness of manner
said Mr Pecksniff, towering on tiptoe among the curtains, as if he were literally rising above all worldly considerations, and were fain to hold on tight, to keep himself from darting skyward like a rocket
said Mr Pecksniff, glancing at the pen-and-ink
he cried, almost writhing in the bed
said the gentleman, shaking his forefinger before his nose, and planting his legs wider apart as he looked attentively in Mr Pecksniff's face
asked Mr Pecksniff, obviously not quite at his ease
said Mr Tigg, clapping one hand on the shoulder of his prepossessing friend, and calling Mr Pecksniff's attention to him with the other
continued Pecksniff even more gravely and impressively than he had spoken yet
and here Mr Pecksniff eyed him wistfully
said Slyme, regardless of the interruption
cried Tigg, gravely nodding his head as if some ground of objection occurred to him at that moment for the first time
said Mr Pecksniff, rising and looking round upon them with folded hands
it is impossible to conceive how he smiled here
remarked Mr Spottletoe, with his whiskers in a very portentous state
pursued Mr Spottletoe in a great heat, and giving a violent rap on the table with his knuckles
said Mr Pecksniff in resumption of his address
said Mr Pecksniff, with a forgiving recollection of Mr Spottletoe's fist
said Anthony, who had been watching the whole party with peculiar keenness from the first
here Mr Pecksniff sunk his voice to an impressive whisper
here he raised his voice again
said Mr Pecksniff, crossing his two forefingers in a manner which was at once conciliatory and argumentative
one of his ornamental sentences
said Mr Pecksniff, smiling upon his assembled kindred
said Mr Pecksniff, with his own peculiar urbanity
interposed the strong-minded woman, sternly
said Mr George Chuzzlewit, greatly stimulated by this retort
said Mr George, nodding his head violently at every second syllable
Mark replied, in some confusion
said Mark, shaking his head argumentatively
said Mr Pinch, who in the progress of his observation just then made the discovery that the bosom of his companion's shirt was as much exposed as if it was Midsummer, and was ruffled by every breath of air
returned Martin, shaking hands with him again
said Tom, in a lower voice
said Mr Pecksniff, turning round after the contemplation of these passages, and taking Mr Pinch in a friendly manner by the elbow
said Mr Pecksniff, in a deeper voice
said Mr Pecksniff, opening the door of an opposite parlour
said Mr Pecksniff, waving his hand towards the wall
said Mr Pecksniff, throwing wide the door of the memorable two-pair front
he said, in allusion to the party, not the wine
observed Mr Pecksniff, in explanation
said Mr Pecksniff, resuming his former cheerfulness
said Mr Pecksniff, smiling compassionately
he said, searching among the papers
said Mr Pecksniff, folding his hands, and looking at his young relation with an air of pensive interest
continued Mr Pecksniff, clapping his young friend on the back in his droll humour
said Mr Pecksniff, in conclusion
said Tom, taking a letter from his pocket and wiping his face, for he was hot with bustling about though it was a cold day
rejoined Martin, with greater earnestness
said Martin, beginning with a kind of effort, as if the revelation were not agreeable to him
pursued the other, stirring the fire again, and speaking in his rapid, off-hand way
resumed Martin, stirring the fire once more, and drawing his chair still closer to it
he rejoined, with a slight frown
rejoined Martin, throwing himself back in his chair, with a careless wave of both hands, as if the subject were quite settled, and nothing more could be said about it
said Tom, with a smile which, despite the homeliness of his face, was pleasanter to see than many a proud beauty's brightest glance
he added, after a moment's pause, as he drew his chair towards the fire again
Here he rumpled his hair impatiently with his hand, and looked at Tom as if he took it rather ill that he was not somebody else
cried Tigg, kissing his hand again, and beginning to follow his head into the room
he added, shielding his lips with the palm of his hand, and applying them close to Mr Pinch's ear
whispered Tigg in the same cautious manner as before
said Mr Tigg with a passionate flourish of his hands and head
said Tom after a pause
added Mr Tigg, stroking his moustache
to whom he made a rough kind of bow
urged Mr Pinch, interposing to prevent hostilities
cried Mark, with a grin
said Mr Tapley, pointing, in conclusion, to Mr Tigg, with his hat
said Martin, interposing between this candid speech and the delivery of some blighting anathema by Mr Tigg
said Mr Tigg, clapping him on the back
cried Mr Slyme, giving the table an imbecile blow with his fist, and then feebly leaning his head upon his hand, while some drunken drops oozed from his eyes
cried Mr Tigg, joining the young men at the door, and shutting it carefully behind him
cried Mr Tigg, detaining him with both hands
observed Mark, pointing after their late guests
pursued Mark, with a thoughtful face
pursued the landlady, with a most engaging hesitation
pursued the hostess -- and it really was not an unnatural inquiry
said Mark, throwing off all his constraint in an instant and seizing the hostess round the waist -- at which she was not at all alarmed, for she knew what a good young man he was
he added this in a grave tone, to prevent the possibility of any mistake
said Mr Tapley in conclusion
he added, looking at her in a sort of rapture
said Mr Pecksniff with tears in his eyes, as he shook his fist at a beggar who wanted to get up behind
resumed her parent with increased emphasis
said the old man, after a moment's pause
said Mr Pecksniff, returning to his usual mildness
and the second (when he got into two syllables
cried that more prudent damsel
said Mr Pecksniff with exquisite tenderness
said Mr Pecksniff, looking in at the door
said Mrs Todgers, warming herself in a gentlemanly manner at the fire
cried Mrs Todgers, raising her eyes and shaking her head
returned Mrs Todgers, nodding her head with mysterious intelligence
she added, glancing gratefully at his two daughters
said Tom Pinch's sister, with Tom's own simplicity and Tom's own smile
said Ruth Pinch, who now that her first surprise was over, had a chatty, cheerful way with her, and a single-hearted desire to look upon the best side of everything, which was the very moral and image of Tom
cried Mr Pecksniff whose eyes had in the meantime wandered to the pupil
said Mr Pecksniff, producing one of his professional cards
said the footman, suddenly appearing, and speaking in exactly the same key as before
said Mr Pecksniff, looking in his pensive mood hard at the footman, as if he meant him
said Mr Pecksniff, feigning to point out other beauties with his hand
he whispered, stopping in one of his journeys to and fro
said Mrs Todgers, setting down the dish
as that young lady observed
said Mr Pecksniff, shedding tears and speaking with an imperfect articulation
said Mr Pecksniff, falling heavily against her
cried Mr Pecksniff, looking over the banisters
said Mr Pecksniff, leaning over the banisters, with an odd recollection of his familiar manner among new pupils at home
said Martin, waving his hand impatiently
Martin resumed, looking steadily at him, and speaking in a slow and measured tone
he laid great stress upon these words, though Mr Pecksniff particularly begged him not to mention it
returned Mr Pecksniff, slipping into a chair immediately
cried Mr Pecksniff with increasing obsequiousness
resumed Mr Pecksniff, with still greater deference
said Martin, who had been sitting with his hand upon his brow for some time past, and now looked up again
said the old man thoughfully
said old Martin, leaning back in his chair
said the old man, dismissing this passionate outburst as suddenly as he had yielded to it
cried Pecksniff in an ecstasy
said Martin, taking a folded slip of paper from his pocketbook
said Mr Pecksniff, drying his hands upon his handkerchief, and looking anxiously in his cousin's face at almost every word
said the young gentleman who had been the youngest gentleman in company on the day of the festival
said he, snapping his fingers
said the youngest gentleman, in a desperate voice
cried that lady, as she came into the back room, and sat wearily down, with her basket on her knees, and her hands folded upon it
cried Charity, pausing in her work
said Charity, with some sharpness
said Merry, with engaging candour
added Cherry with an angry glance
and being told that Mr Jinkins and party paid, was beyond description entertained, observing that
said Mr Jonas, apart to the young ladies
he added in a louder voice
cried the old man, brightening up as before, when this was communicated to him in the same voice
whispered Mr Jonas to his favourite cousin
said Mrs Todgers, when they retired to rest on the last night of their stay
said Mrs Todgers, perceiving this
said the lady of the house
said Mrs Todgers, with her usual foresight
said Mr Bailey, stung by the recollection of his wrongs
added Mr Bailey, relenting into a smile
rejoined Mr Pecksniff in his most candid manner
said Mr Pecksniff, with his eyes still closed
added Anthony, laying his hand upon his sleeve
said the new pupil one day, as he stood at a little distance from his drawing, and eyed it with much complacency
said Tom, shaking his head
pursued Martin, after a short reflection
said Martin, looking with a smile towards the light
said Martin leaning his chin upon his hand, and looking through the window-glass as if he read there what he said
said Tom, characteristically putting himself quite out of sight in the matter
said Martin, glancing over it with his customary coolness
pursued John, filling his own glass, and looking at his companion with some curiosity
replied John Westlock, shrugging his shoulders
he said, when he had gazed at his friend for some time in silent pleasure
cried Pinch, turning to Martin
said John Westlock, laughing heartily, as he laid his hand on Mr Pinch's shoulder
cried his friend, shaking him to and fro with both hands, and smiling at him with a cheerful, open countenance, that would have carried conviction to a mind much more suspicious than Tom's
said the other, giving his hand a hearty squeeze
answered Tom, with great gravity
said Pecksniff, waving his hand and smiling
said Martin at last, in a very quiet voice
said Mr Pecksniff, turning his eyes on Tom Pinch, even more placidly and gently than before
he said, softly rapping the table twice or thrice, and moving a step or two nearer, so that he could have touched him with his hand
he raised his voice a little here
said Mr Pecksniff in a severe voice, as he looked at him for the first time
here he struck himself upon his breast, or moral garden
said Martin, handing him the mug, and pulling on his coat with great alacrity
said Bill, with a sigh, as he drew the back of his hand across his lips, and put this instrument in his pocket, after screwing off the mouth-piece to drain it
said a low voice in the next box to the shopman who was in treaty with him
said Mr Tigg, stretching out his body so far that his head was as much in Martin's little cell as Martin's own head was
here he winked at Martin, that he might understand this recommendation would have an immense effect upon the shopman
observed Martin, biting his lip
said Mr Tigg, striking himself upon the breast
said Mr Tigg, with sudden dignity
returned Mark, quite unmoved by this intelligence
said Martin, leaning his chin upon his hand, and looking at the fire
he added, after a moment's thought
said Mark, rubbing his hands
exclaimed Martin, clutching him by both arms
cried Mark, giving the little table such a blow with his clenched fist that the slices of beef and ham danced upon it, while all his features seemed, with delight, to be going up into his forehead, and never coming back again any more
cried Mr Tapley, with a comical mixture of delight and chagrin
said Mark, rubbing his nose with the knob at the end of the fire-shovel, and looking round the poor chamber
said Martin at length, as he looked upon her with a proud delight
said Martin as he drew her waist within his arm, first looking round to see that there were no observers near, and beholding Mr Tapley more intent than ever on the fog
he added slowly, looking far into the deep wonder of her bright dark eyes
she answered, raising her head after a short silence, and looking once more into his face
he added, in a gentler tone
said Martin, playing with the little hand upon his wrist
said Martin, suddenly remembering that he was proud when they had last met
resumed Martin, proceeding with his letter
said Martin, checking himself, and folding up the letter
said Mary, echoing his cheerful tone
he drew her quickly to him, for the time of parting had now come
said Mark, taking a long breath
here he stroked his chin and mused
said Mr Tapley, pursuing the theme by way of soliloquy in a low tone of voice
said Mark, nodding to a woman who was dressing her three children at no great distance from him -- and the grin upon his face had by this time spread from ear to ear --'Hand over one of them young
said Mr Tapley to the second urchin, who was by this time under his hands at the basin
said Mr Tapley, in a low voice
returned Martin, with a scronful emphasis upon the words
said Mr Tapley, looking far ahead
said a voice almost in Martin's ear
he added, bringing the ferule of his stick heavily upon the deck with the air of a man who must not be equivocated with
he said, turning round towards Martin, and resting his chin on the top of his stick
said, or rather sung, the captain, who was a genuine New Englander
said the colonel, turning to Martin, and drawing a flourish on the surface of the deck with his cane
said Martin, who had by this time quite recovered his usual coolness
said the colonel, filling Martin's glass and his own, and pushing the bottle to that gentleman
said Martin, after some hesitation
he pursued, for the colonel was perfectly calm and quite at his ease
said the colonel, stooping down to roll the third empty bottle into a corner after the other two
said the colonel; 'then we got it all from the old country, and the old country's to blame for it, and not the new
said Martin clapping him on the back
he observed after a short silence, in commendation of his correspondent
said Martin, turning to him, and asking a question more for conversation's sake than from any feeling of interest in its subject
said one of the captains, who was from the West
said Martin, pursuing the current of his own thoughts
said this gentleman with a smile, as he rose and moved towards him
returned Martin, as they shook hands
said Martin, getting the better of his hesitation
said the other, shrugging his shoulders
said Mark, shaking his head
said Martin, glancing, but not with any displeasure, from Mark to the negro
returned Mark, taking him aside, and speaking confidentially in his ear
he answered, shaking his head
cried Martin, clapping his hand upon his mouth
said Mr Norris the father, settling the question comfortably
said Martin's friend, in a low voice
he lowered his voice and was very impressive here
cried Mr Norris the father, giving his head a melancholy shake, and looking towards Martin as though he would say
said Martin, after a terrible silence
said Mr Norris the father, looking with a pale face on the assembled circle as Martin closed the door
said Martin, dropping into one of the chairs
said Mark, taking it from him with a triumphant face
said Mark, tenderly patting the empty glass
said Martin, in a thoughtful tone
whispered Mark Tapley, when he was out of hearing and in his own room
whimpered old Anthony, drawing near the evening fire
observed the amiable Jonas, raising his eyes from yesterday's newspaper
he grumbled, but in the same subdued key
thought Jonas in a brown study
he added in his gentle way as he laid his hand upon the young man's shoulder
answered Jonas, recovering himself and snuffing the candle
said Mr Pecksniff to Anthony
said Mr Pecksniff, previously rising to see that the door was shut, and arranging his chair when he came back, so that it could not be opened in the least without his immediately becoming aware of the circumstance
said the old man, hoarsely
thought Mr Pecksniff, looking at him with a wistful face
said Mr Pecksniff, with great feeling
said Mrs Gamp with emphasis
here she kept her eye on Mr Pecksniff
he continued, addressing Mr Pecksniff
opening his eyes wide, and standing on tiptoe
said Mould, waving his hand at the public in general
said Mould, in the same biting vein, as he pocketed his note-book
he said, in a whisper
said Mrs Gamp, laying greater and greater stress upon her words
said Mrs Gamp, again entrenching herself behind her strong point, as if it were not assailable by human ingenuity
said Mr Pecksniff, turning to Jonas
said Mrs Gamp, probably in reference to some flowers of speech she had already strewn on Mr Chuffey
here he filled his glass again
said Mr Mould, waving his watch-chain slowly round and round, so that he described one circle after every item
rejoined Mr Mould, putting up his watch, and glancing at himself in the little shaving-glass, that he might be sure his face had the right expression on it
said Mould, casting an imploring glance upon them, as he helped to raise him
murmured the doctor, in a tone of stately reproof, as he stepped up to the old man's side
said Jonas, taking off his hat, to see that the black crape band was all right; and finding that it was, putting it on again, complacently
cried the affectionate parent, with an ingenuous smile
retorted Jonas, eyeing Mr Pecksniff with no great favour
said Mr Pecksniff, laying his hand tenderly upon his kinsman's knee
said Mr Pecksniff, after a short silence
said Mr Pecksniff, warming with his subject
he said, at last, with captivating bluntness
Such was his jocose address, as he slapped that gentleman on the back, at the end of the stage
said Pecksniff with great solemnity
urged Mr Pecksniff, very much dismayed
cried the arch girl, turning to her cousin when she had kissed her father on both cheeks, and in her frolicsome nature had bestowed a supernumerary salute upon the tip of his nose
said Jonas, clasping the waist of each
said Tom, standing, cap in hand, before his patron in the passage
he was all in a tremble, and dropped his hat for the second time
said Mr Pecksniff, with an icy look
added Tom, raising his eyes to his benefactor's face
said Martin, looking at him with an anxious expression
added Mark, after a pause
returned Mark, who, full of the inspiriting influence of the anecodote upon himself, had for the moment forgotten its probable effect upon his master
he repeated, nodding condescendingly to Martin, as to an outer barbarian and foreigner
resumed their new friend, after staring at them intently during the whole interval of silence
said the speaker, poking Martin with the handle of his umbrella to bespeak his attention, for he was listening to a whisper from Mark
said Mr La Fayette Kettle
observed Mr Tapley, affecting the greatest politeness, and regarding them with an immovable face
returned the General, in the same benignant way
pursued the General, smiling with a mild consciousness of his knowledge
said Martin, addressing himself to the General again
said the General, setting up his umbrella to represent himself, and a villanous-looking umbrella it was; a very bad counter to stand for the sterling coin of his benevolence
said Martin, in his old way, just as he might have spoken to Tom Pinch
Mark rejoined, much more sadly than his custom was, though from a very different cause than Martin supposed
said Martin, who never hammered upon an idea that wasn't red hot
he added, in a low voice
returned the agent, in reproachful accents
said Martin, glancing again at the Public Buildings
said Martin, feigning to look more narrowly at the plan, but showing by his tremulous voice how much depended, in his mind, upon the answer
whispered Martin, pulling him by the sleeve
he said, with some irritation
he said, leaving his knife quivering in the wall
said Scadder, as he gave Martin the necessary credentials on recepit of his money
said the General, giving him his hand with grave cordiality
he said, as he shook hands with Martin
said the young Columbian, in a wrestling attitude
cried the young Columbian, idealising the dining-table
said the General, when he could make himself heard
said Martin, seeing that the Captain was about to go
said Martin, bringing his hand heavily upon the table
and added then, as coming down a step or two to meet his low capacity
said Mark, as gently as he could by any means insinuate the observation
knocking his stick upon the ground
cried Mr Tapley, in great terror
cried Mark, running out to suit the action to the word
said Mark, when they had made a hearty meal
said Mark, bringing forward Martin's case of instruments and sticking the compasses upright in a stump before the door
said Mark, giving himself a tremendous blow in the chest by way of reviver
here he pointed to his spade, and shook his head as if he were not cheerful without an effort
retorted Pecksniff, raising his voice for the edification of Tom upon the stairs
said Mr Pecksniff, answering their looks
he said after a pause, rising and taking him aside towards the window
said Mr Pecksniff, with a melancholy pressure of his hand
said Mr Pecksniff, smiling dispassionately
said Mr Pecksniff, taking both his hands
said Mr Pecksniff, as he left the room
said Jonas, looking up again for a moment, and shaking his head
he whispered, as they drew their chairs about the table
said Martin, on the way
cried Jonas, with increased contempt
Tom snapped his fingers at him, for he was rising fast in wrath
he turned his face towards Tom, but not his eyes
said the old man, with unusual kindness
he said, pointing to the graves
cried Merry, nodding her head and giggling very much
cried Miss Mercy, in counterfeit amazement
said Jonas, venturing on another squeeze
said Jonas, looking after her, and biting a piece of straw, almost to powder
said Mrs Gamp, turning with a tearful smile towards the daughters
said Mould, with a chuckle
said Mrs Gamp with meekness
said Mrs Gamp, dropping a curtsey
he observed, when Mrs Gamp had at last withdrawn and shut the door
said Mould, drawing his silk handkerchief over his head again, and composing himself for a nap
dropping a curtsey to the landlady
Mrs Gamp addressed herself to John on this head
said Mrs Gamp, walking away from the bed
said Mrs Gamp to the assistant chambermaid, in a tone expressive of weakness
sighed Mrs Gamp, as she meditated over the warm shilling's- worth
said Mrs Gamp, coming out of the chair with an impatient shiver
observed Mrs Prig, when they had curtseyed the doctor out
speaking with great feeling, and laying her hand upon her arm
said Mr Bailey, with a wink
she said to her landlord
cried Mr Bailey, slapping a little cloud of pipe-clay out of his left leg
said Mrs Gamp, dropping a curtsey as they entered the hall
said Jonas carelessly, as he dusted his boots
said Mrs Gamp, with a look of great sweetness, and rummaging all the time in her pocket
Mrs Gamp observed, in a low voice
Mrs Gamp remarked below stairs, in a whisper
inquiring of elderly ladies who wanted to cross, and ran back again
cried the secretary, with another laugh
asked the secretary, bursting into another laugh
said Tigg, returning after a time to his companion's first remark
David was obliged to confess
pursued the doctor, turning back his cuffs and spanning the limb with both hands
returned the doctor, shaking his head
the doctor closed one eye, as he leaned back smilingly in his chair, and formed a triangle with his hands, of which his two thumbs composed the base
touching one of the many mourning rings upon his fingers, and slightly bowing his head
says the doctor, turning to the patient's wife
said the doctor, filling his glass
he added checking himself with infinite policy, and looking round with a smile
said Tigg, drawing his chair towards Jonas with a winning ease of manner
cried Tigg, clapping him on the shoulder
said Tigg, nodding confidentially, and showing his white teeth
returned Jonas, with a cunning shake of the head
said Tigg, referring to some papers on the table
said Jonas, gazing at it
he whispered this, and nudged him in the side with his elbow
said Tigg in his ear
said Montague, giving him a pleasant thrust in the breast
said Tigg, pointing to the cabriolet
said Montague, slapping him on the back
said Montague, copying Jonas Chuzzlewit's address upon a piece of paper, from the card which was still lying on the table
said Montague, as soon as the doctor would allow him to introduce the two others
observed the doctor, laying down his knife and fork for one instant, and then going to work again, pell-mell
said Bailey to Mr Jonas
moaned Mrs Gamp, sinking into the shaving chair
said the barber, opening his eyes, and putting on his raven aspect
he checked himself; adding, only
observed Poll, rubbing his hands
said Mrs Gamp, cutting him very short
added the good woman, rising and folding her shawl about her
he added, laughing, as he kindly arranged the sick man's garments
Mrs Gamp replied with dignity
said Mr Pecksniff, rolling his head portentously
said Charity, rocking her chair backwards and forwards, and raising her voice to a high pitch
here she began to cry and sob
cried Mr Pecksniff, as he resumed his seat and fetched his breath
sobbed Cherry, clasping her hands
said Mr Pecksniff, with returning resignation
he added, holding out his hand and colouring again
said Cherry, with increasing stateliness
said Mr Pecksniff with emotion
repeated Mr Pecksniff, sticking up his hair and glancing at his bust by Spoker
said Mr Pecksniff, meeting old Martin in the garden, for it was his habit to walk in and out by that way, as the fancy took him
said Mr Pecksniff, taking the old man's arm in his, and walking slowly on
repeated Martin, with a glimmer of his old obstinacy
she answered, turning her glowing cheek indignantly upon him
said Mr Pecksniff, examining the rings upon her fingers, and tracing the course of one delicate blue vein with his fat thumb
said Mr Pecksniff, apostrophizing the reluctant prize
Mary answered, in a hurried manner
said Mary, who finding that good words had not the least effect upon him, made no further effort to suppress her indignation
observed Mr Pecksniff, with a placid leer
resumed Mr Pecksniff, chafing the captive hand reproachfully
said Mr Pecksniff, with a playful tightening of his grasp
he added, with bewitching frankness
Tom continued with an embarrassment that became him very well
said Mary, giving him her hand
replied Tom, shaking his head
he added, with a rapid change in his tone
pursued the agitated girl, extending it
cried Tom, in great excitement
said Tom Pinch, rising from his stool and looking down into the church as if he had been the Clergyman
Tom continued, little thinking who heard him
cried Mr Pecksniff, in an agony
said Mr Pecksniff, looking upward
said Mr Pecksniff, taking courage
cried Martin, in a tremble
said Pecksniff, shaking his head
said Pecksniff, taking up his handkerchief, as if he felt that he should want it soon
said Mr Pecksniff, dropping a penny
said Mr Pecksniff, knocking down another penny
cried Mr Pecksniff, shedding tears
returned that lady in a hollow voice
said Mrs Todgers, proceeding with her subject
said Mrs Todgers putting her hand to her side
he added, looking down upon the boys
said Mark, looking round the room
said Mr Tapley, sitting down upon a stool
he confided to Martin in a leisure moment; that is to say, one evening, while he was washing the linen of the establishment, after a hard day's work
said Mr Tapley, scrubbing away at the linen
and a great knife, which (for he was a man of a pleasant turn of humour) he called
said Mark, addressing this new visitor
he said one morning, sinking back upon his bed
returned Mr Tapley, with a significant stress upon the words
Martin went on to say
said Mr Tapley, shaking his head with a rueful air
said the stranger -- Mr Pogram having overheard every word of the dialogue
said Martin, after a moment's hesitation
said Pogram, looking round upon the group
said Pogram, looking round again and taking himself up where Martin had interrupted him
said the spokesman, with a hopeless look
said Buffum, laying hands on Mr Pogram as if he were taking his measure for a coat
said the lady in the wig
said Mark in high glee
returned the landlord, who seemed to have an unspeakable delight in the repetition of these words
said the Gentlemanly member -- of course he added "if he will allow me to call him so," and of course Mr Pecksniff bowed
thought Tom, straining his eyes
returned his friend, with great earnestness of manner, after remaining silent for a few moments
said Tom, extending his hand
said Tom, relinquishing the paper with a thoughtful sigh
said Tom, looking at her with great pride, when they had tenderly embraced each other
said Tom, with inexpressible delight
said Tom, looking at her more intently
cried the gentleman, looking round the room with dignity
cried Tom, rising from his seat; for he was now unable to contain himself any longer
interposed the brass-and-copper founder, haughtily
said Tom, which was quite true
resumed Tom, who was not the less indignant for keeping himself quiet
said Tom, much flushed and flustered, now that it was over
thought Tom, quickening his pace
cried Charity, with sharp impatience
returned Miss Pecksniff, pointing with her parasol to Todgers's
she added, looking hurriedly into his face
quoth Mrs Todgers, shutting the door softly
said Mrs Todgers, drawing in her breath
said Mrs Todgers, taking her pocket-handkerchief from the flat reticule
said Mrs Todgers, putting back her handkerchief again
he said, as they rode along
said Jonas, with an air of langour and ill-humour, as he took a chair
said Tigg, raising his voice
said Jonas in his sulky way
interrupted Jonas, who became more coarse and quarrelsome as the other remonstrated, which may have been a part of Mr Montague's intention
said Tigg, with a remarkable kind of smile
he said, when he was quite equipped
returned his sister, still laughing merrily
he said with some emotion
said Tom, leaning back in his chair, and looking up in her face
Tom's energy became quite grand
said Tom, repeating to himself
said John, with a smile
pursued John Westlock, glancing at Tom's sister, who was not less eager in her interest than Tom himself
resumed John Westlock, laying his hand on Tom's wrist, to bespeak his attention, and repress his ecstasies for the moment
said Tom, in great perplexity
John resumed, still keeping his hand upon Tom's wrist
said Ruth, after a little hesitation
he said, as they were walking along
said Fips, taking off a very deep impression of the wafer- stamp upon the calf of his left leg, and looking steadily at Tom
said Tom, whose countenance was now suffused with pleasure
cried Mr Fips, pulling on his glove
said John Westlock, seating himself upon a pile of books, and looking up at his astonished friend
returned the lady, somewhat softened
said Mrs Gamp, casting up her eyes
returned that lady, dropping her voice
said Mrs Gamp, shaking her umbrella at it
said Mrs Gamp, resuming her apostrophe
he added, following Tom's gaze
cried his landlord, pointing eagerly again
said the gentleman, raising his hat in compliment to Mrs Chuzzlewit
said Montague, breaking off in his discourse, and looking at Mrs Gamp
returned Mrs Gamp, dropping an indignant curtsey
she clasped her hands distractedly
he answered, looking round abruptly
pursued Jonas, with a still greater effort
Jonas proceeded, with a savage sneer that got the better of him for the moment
Jonas went on to say
said the doctor smacking his lips after a glass of wine
said the doctor, leaning back in his chair
said the doctor, shaking his head
said Montague, recoiling instinctively, and speaking in a voice that betrayed his agitation
he muttered with a laugh
cried Montague to the postillion
said Montague with an effort
said Jonas, stooping down over the body
said Mrs Lupin, with increased distress
said Mark, after a short silence
said Mrs Lupin, adjusting her cap and laughing heartily; yes, and blushing too
observed the hostess in conclusion, spreading out the skirts of her gown with both hands, and nodding her head a great many times as she did so
here the colour came into her cheeks
said Martin, turning crimson at the thought
returned the politic Mr Tapley
he laid uncommon emphasis on the last syllable of that word, and looked full in Martin's face
Mr Tapley bestowed a smile upon the hostess
Mark had taken up this position, and held it quite unmoved
said the old man, stretching out his hand
observed Mr Pecksniff, as Chorus
said Martin, turning towards Mark
addressing the elder Mr Chuzzlewit
pursued the Chorus, soaring up into a lofty flight
said Martin, looking calmly at the old man as he spoke, but glancing once at Mary, whose face was now buried in her hands, upon the back of his easy-chair
cried Mr Pecksniff, bending over him
said Mr Pecksniff, sitting down beside him in a chair which he drew up for the purpose, and tapping him playfully on the arm
said Mr Pecksniff, shaking his hand vigorously
said Mr Pecksniff, quite transported with enthusiasm
said Mr Pecksniff, shaking his head at Martin with indignant jocularity
replied Martin, strong in his purpose from the first, and stronger in it as he felt how Pecksniff winced and shrunk beneath his contempt
said Martin, in a low voice
said Martin, hurriedly; as indeed everything else was done and said, in those few hurried moments
said Martin, with a melancholy smile
cried Mr Pecksniff, with much warmth
cried Mr Pecksniff, much affected
said Mr Pecksniff, pressing his hand almost reverentially
just as often Mr Pecksniff repeated
cried Mr Pecksniff, shaking his head in pity
repeated Mr Pecksniff, stretching out his hand
he returned, glancing at him with a smile
said his friend, as they turned into the noisy street
said Tom, regarding her with smiling admiration
said Miss Pecksniff, with loquacious frankness
interrupted Moddle, with a hollow laugh
said Mrs Gamp, smiling with the consciousness of at once imparting pleasure and instruction to her auditors
said Cherry, raising her voice a little
said Charity, looking after her betrothed and glancing at her sister
here she was modest and embarrased
returned Miss Pecksniff, with a stately scorn -- by the way, she had not been offered any
cried Jonas, fiercely catching up the chair
said Mrs Gamp, looking at him with her head on one side, as if he had been a piece of goods, for which she was driving a bargain
he added, pushing away his untouched plate, and striding moodily to and fro
said Tom, coming so abruptly on the subject, that he interrupted himself in the act of cutting a slice of bread, and left the knife sticking in the loaf
said Tom, shaking his head as if this were a most tremendous threat
or addressing him in any such distant terms; cried out
said Tom, with his pleasantest smile
replied John, with some reluctance
said Tom, with an uneasy sense of seeming to doubt his friend
retorted Mr Tapley, in a spirit of unbounded confidence
said Tom, who laughed heartily at this speech
added John, with a smile, as he subsided into more of his accustomed manner
John pursued -- looking attentively at him, and not at Martin
said Martin, turning from him
said the barber in a faint voice
cried the little barber, looking round him at the cages, and again applying to the towel
said Mrs Gamp, shaking her head
cried the barber, coming back again to the subject of his individual grief
said Mrs Gamp, filling her own glass and passing the teapot
said Mrs Gamp, shaking her head, and shedding tears
Mrs Gamp replied, after glancing in an expressive and marked manner at the tea-pot
said Mrs Gamp, surveying her with scorn from head to foot
said Mrs Prig, with a rapid change from banter to ferocity
Mrs Gamp, by the way, was pretty far gone, and the fragrance of the teapot was strong in the room
said Mrs Gamp, in a violent burst of feeling
cried Mrs Gamp, trampling on the floor, in the absence of Mrs Prig
by which Mrs Gamp is supposed to have meant mask
whispered John, looking cautiously towards her
he said, with a little hesitation
his calmness rather failed him here
said Tom; who, had not removed his mild gaze from Martin's face since the commencement of this last address
they seemed to avoid the name by mutual consent
said Tom, with a grave smile
said Tom, with a glow of pride
said Tom, with a smile
thought Tom, recalling all the little incidents and circumstances
said Tom, looking towards the door
said the old man, hurriedly -- his eyes and whole face brightening as he spoke
interrupted Jonas, but in a suppressed voice still
she said, in a sort of quavering croak
he added, looking fiercely at John Westlock and Mark Tapley (the latter had entered with Lewsome
cried Mr Tapley, coming forward
cried the old man with a childish delight
said his old master's brother
said Chuffey, stretching out his arm towards Jonas while an unwonted fire shone in his eye, and lightened up his face
pursued the old clerk, as he wiped his eyes
said Jonas, looking downward with a smile
said Slyme, taking a fresh handful of nuts from his pocket
touching Lewsome on the arm
said Nadgett, pointing across the narrow street
said Mark, taking up the thread of the narrative, on hearing this allusion to himself
said Nadgett, putting up his great pocketbook, which from mere habit he had produced when he began his revelation, and had kept in his hand all the time
replied Mr Tapley, whose mind would appear from the context to have been running on the matrimonial service
replied Mark, without the loss of any atom of his self-possession
said Mr Pecksniff, addressing himself in a tone of gentle remonstrance to the old man
said the old man, looking kindly down upon her
Mr Chuzzlewit went on to say
returned the old man, sorrowfully
said Mr Tapley, who had Mrs Lupin on his arm by this time, quite agreeably
his fertility in finding names for Mr Pecksniff was astonishing
said Mr Tapley, retiring, with a bow, towards the buxom hostess
said Mr Pecksniff, taking out his pocket-handkerchief
here he became exceedingly plaintive and was observed to glance towards Tom Pinch
said Mrs Gamp, eyeing Mr Sweedlepipe with great indignation
cried the little barber, taking off his hat
he added this half laughing and half crying
said old Martin, looking gravely at the astonished Mrs Gamp
he said, taking a case from his pocket
retorted Cherry; very red and angry in a moment
returned Miss Pecksniff, with dignity
he said, as soon as he observed it
