said the man, immediately aware of it, though so intent on the advancing waters
said a man with a squinting leer, who sculled her and who was alone
says Mr Veneering, nodding emotionally at that new article
says Mr Veneering to Mrs Veneering, with an air of much friendly interest, while the door stands open
says the large man, trying to attract the attention of his wife in the distance
in his fatal freshness he seems to find perpetual verdure and eternal youth in the phrase
says Lady Tippins, rapping the sticks of her closed green fan upon the knuckles of her left hand -- which is particularly rich in knuckles
Mortimer goes on, addressing Eugene
Mortimer repeats with a passing remembrance that there is a Veneering at table, and for the first time addressing him
cried Mortimer, turning round with his hat upon his head
said Mortimer, as they went along
returned Mortimer, with great composure
said Eugene, putting his legs up on the opposite seat
said Eugene, leaning back, folding his arms, smoking with his eyes shut, and speaking slightly through his nose
said Mortimer, glancing rather shrinkingly towards the bunk
moving the light to another similar placard
moving the light to another
asked Gaffer Hexam, stopping short
said Mortimer, breaking the awkward silence with his airy self-possession
said Mr Inspector, with an attentive ear
said Mr Inspector, with no change of voice or manner
said the boy, pressing her to him twice or thrice
said the girl, who had not changed her attitude since she began, and who now mournfully shook her head
to Mrs Wilfer already seated in a corner with folded gloves
said her husband, making the stipulation at once in a conciliatory, complimentary, and argumentative tone
insinuated the landlord, expecting it to be received as a matter of course
returned the gentleman, after a pause
said Bella, holding him by the chin, as she stuck his flaxen hair on end
said Bella, sipping the fragrant mixture and warming her favourite ankle
returned her father, as if the remembrance gave a relish to the rum
said Lavinia when the two girls were alone in their room
said Mr Wegg, to himself
said Mr Wegg, as before
pursued the old fellow, in an inquisitive manner, carrying his knotted stick in his left arm as if it were a baby
returned Silas, drily, and with reticence
repeated the other to his knotted stick, as he gave it a hug
retorted Mr Wegg, again approaching desperation
retorted Mr Wegg, approaching frenzy
said Mr Boffin, smiling still
said Mr Wegg, bestirring himself to take the same precaution as before
said Mr Boffin, hugging his stick closer
added Mr Wegg, looking a little round Mr Boffin, to take him in the rear, and identify this last extraordinary coincidence
exclaimed Mr Boffin, in a tone of great enjoyment, as he settled himself down, still nursing his stick like a baby
Mr Wegg delicately hinted, resting a hand on his stall, and bending over the discursive Boffin
returned Mr Wegg, with a conscious inclination of the head
pursued Mr Boffin, leaning forward to describe, uncramped by the clotheshorse, as large an arc as his right arm could make
Mr Wegg admitted, with modesty
said Mr Wegg, throwing in a little encouragement
tapping him on the breast with the head of his thick stick
said Boffin, in a free-handed manner
said Mr Boffin, clapping him on the shoulder with the greatest enthusiasm
he said, filling his own
you took the bold practical course of saying
said Wegg with an air of insinuating frankness (having first again looked hard at the book
said Miss Abbey Potterson, with emphatic forefinger over the half-door
this was suggested very meekly though
said Miss Potterson, with a manner as short as she herself was long
suggested Miss Abbey, though with a deeper shade of perplexity than before
returned the other, stretching forward over the half door to throw his words into the bar; for his voice was as if the head of his boat's mop were down his throat
not only did the captain feebly rub his knees and contemplate the fire without offering a word of protest, but the rest of the company murmured
said Miss Abbey to this pot-boy
said Miss Abbey, pushing away the untasted dish
remarked Miss Potterson, rubbing her vexed nose
said Lizzie, as a recollection flashed upon her
towelling at himself as if he were his bitterest enemy
said the boy, then, bursting out into an angry whimpering
said Gaffer, dropping the liquor into his cup from a squat black bottle, and dropping it slowly that it might seem more
Silas pursues, stumping and meditating
Mr Wegg inwardly decides, as he takes a corrective sniff or two
replies Venus, who is a haggard melancholy man, speaking in a weak voice of querulous complaint
Wegg expostulates with some little irritation
says Mr Wegg, with a sort of sense of being introduced
sighs Mr Venus, heavily, snuffing the candle
replies Venus, still blowing his tea
remarks Silas (though not quite so readily as last time
concluded Mr Lightwood, with an indolent smile
said Mr Boffin, rubbing his ear
making the discovery all of a sudden
said Mr Boffin lowering his voice
said Mr Boffin, warming (as fat usually does) with a tendency to melt
returned Mr Boffin, on whom his manner seemed to grate
remarked Lightwood, with a languid inclination of the head
said Mr Boffin, a little staggered
returned Lightwood, making a very short note of it with a very rusty pen
said Eugene -- though he didn't look so
returned Eugene, with a reluctant smile
urged Mr Boffin, rather at a loss for an answer
said Mr Boffin, stopping short, with his meditations brought to an abrupt check
said Mr Boffin, after a glance at the pavement, as if it were made of faces and he were trying to match the man's
said Mr Boffin, under his breath
pursued the stranger, wondering at Mr Boffin's wonder
returned the other, meeting his eye
returned the other, with another look at him, and a smile
said the stranger, producing a little pocket-book and taking out a card
repeated Mr Boffin, meditating upon the word
Mr Rokesmith answered, evidently having heard it with surprise
returned Mr Boffin, with a confidential sense of dignity
repeated Mr Rokesmith, seeming to have caught the sound imperfectly
returned Mr Boffin, with great presence of mind
said Mrs Boffin, smoothing her dress with an air of immense enjoyment
exclaimed Mrs Boffin, laughing and clapping her hands, and gaily rocking herself to and fro
said Mrs Boffin, coming from her fashionable sofa to his side on the plain settle, and hooking her comfortable arm through his
said Mrs Boffin, once more radiant in her comely way from head to foot, and once more smoothing her dress with immense enjoyment
Mrs Milvey hinted, after a little hesitation
said Mrs Boffin, concerned at giving so much trouble
pursued Mr Milvey, quite with the air as if he might have added
and quite as anxiously as if there were great competition in the business and he were afraid of losing an order
growled the hammer-headed young man through the bars of the gate, and at the same time shaking it, as if he were on view in a Menagerie
said Mrs Wilfer, after the first salutations, and as soon as she had adjusted the handkerchief under her chin, and waved her gloved hands
returned Mrs Wilfer, with a dignified bend of her head
pursued Mr Boffin, while Mrs Boffin added confirmatory nods and smiles
remarked the honest Mr Boffin
Mrs Wilfer explained, on resuming her seat
returned Mrs Wilfer, correcting him
said Miss Bella, coldly shaking her curls
said Mrs Boffin, who was woman enough to compromise Mr Boffin on that point, when he couldn't very well contest it
seating Bella beside her, and patting her hand
said her sister, in a low voice
proceeded Mrs Wilfer, with a withering look at her youngest, on whom it had not the slightest effect
this with an indignant shiver
said the irrepressible Lavinia, spitefully
said Mr Boffin, turning back as he was going
Mrs Wilfer answered, qualifying the low expression
quoth Mr George Sampson, moodily pulling his stopper out
thinks Twemlow, with his eyes on Podsnap
thinks Twemlow, with his eyes wandering
thinks Twemlow, with his eyes rolling
thinks Twemlow, with his eyes shut
saying the words as if the company were about a hundred and fifty in number
Veneering repeats with greater firmness
says Lady Tippins, turning the eyeglass about and about
he coolly recommends as to the parasol
with some inclination to add
pursued Mr Podsnap, with dignity
said Mr Podsnap, resuming the thread of his discourse
said Mr Podsnap, with a gracious consciousness of being always right
Mr Podsnap explained, with a sense of meritorious proprietorship
returned Mr Podsnap, gravely shaking his head
said the foreign gentleman, laughing
added Mr Podsnap, looking round upon his compatriots, and sounding solemnly with his theme
observed Miss Podsnap, after hesitating considerably, and stealing several timid looks at Mrs Lammle's carefully arranged face
returned Mrs Lammle in her winning way
said Mr Podsnap, flushing angrily
quoth Eugene, stirring the fire
said Eugene, smoking with his eyes on the fire
said Eugene, as if he really had been considering the subject in its various bearings with an eye to the business
Eugene acquiesced, with a sigh
replied the ghost, in a hoarse double-barrelled whisper
replied the ghost, as before
returned the ghost, carefully closing the room door
returned the man, in what he meant to be a wheedling tone
ducking at him with a servile air
said Lightwood, with his indolent laugh
said the man, taking a step forward, dropping his hoarse voice, and shading it with his hand
tilted it into his left cheek, as saying
jerked it into his stomach, as saying
said Lightwood, for the third time
answered Riderhood, wiping his face with his sleeve
Eugene observed in a low voice without looking at him
said Eugene, drawing a lady's head upon his writing-paper, and touching it at intervals
said Mr Riderhood, with candour
added Mr Inspector, in conclusion
indicating Riderhood with his thumb over his shoulder
vaguely indicating Miss Abbey with his thumb over his shoulder
said Lightwood, pushing his friend aside with a laugh
Mortimer apostrophized him, laughing quite heartily when they were alone again
Eugene struck in with great deliberation
said Eugene, who was lying on his back with his hat on his face, as an attitude highly expressive of watchfulness
he murmured, lying down again and speaking into his hat
growled Riderhood with a threatening shake of his head
cried Eugene (he had recovered immediately on embarking), as they bumped heavily against a pile; and then in a lower voice reversed his late apostrophe by remarking
he added, at once persuasively and with authority to the hidden object in the water, as he played the line again
and the like, he said composedly
said Mr Inspector, again to Riderhood, when they were all on the slushy stones
stooping to wipe some hailstones out of his hair with an end of his own drowned jacket
lifting the loose neckerchief over his breast, and taking the opportunity of wiping the dead lips with it
taking up one of them, which dropped like a leaden weight
said Lightwood and was about to add
said Eugene, sitting on his bed
returned Mr Boffin, with his hand still to his chin
with a glance and a half-smile at the table
said Mr Boffin, slowly crumpling his own blotted note in his hand
said Mr Boffin, rubbing his hands in his pleasantly childish admiration
cried Mrs Boffin, clapping her hands
said Mr Boffin, who, in his frankness, felt that it did not become him to have a gentleman in his employment five minutes, without reposing some confidence in him
said Mr Boffin, after considering the point
said Mr Boffin, unlocking the door
said Mr Boffin to himself; subsiding into his regular series of turns in the yard
Mr Wegg made a smiling demonstration of great perspicuity here
said Mrs Boffin, as she sat down in a chair to recover herself, and took her husband's arm
said Mrs Boffin, speaking with her eyes closed, and her left hand thoughtfully touching her brow
said she, when the business was opened
cried Mrs Boffin, turning to the Secretary
returned Betty Higden, dropping her voice
said the dame, fondling the child
continued old Betty, caressing the child, and rather mourning over it than speaking to it
said Mrs Boffin, with a face inviting trust
said Betty, still with that light beat upon her hard rough hand
cried Mrs Boffin, looking radiantly about her
with her hand upon her breast
said John Rokesmith, as the majestic lady came stalking up
returned Mrs Wilfer, waving her gloves in her chronic state of dignity, and vague ill-usage
said Mrs Wilfer, with a grand shrug of her shoulders, and another wave of her gloves
repeated Mrs Wilfer, with a vast access of grandeur
said Rokesmith, with a glance at Bella
returned Mrs Wilfer, with dreadful solemnity
returned Miss Peecher, slightly colouring and shaking her head, a little out of humour
said Mary Anne, disconcerted now she came to think of it
returned the boy, with his former reluctance
returned the child, with a glib assertion of her dignity
he returned, pointing to a corner of the little bench
said the person of the house
drawing the back of his hand across them
said the boy, with a confused and pondering frown upon his face
with a curious break both before and after the words
said Bradley Headstone in a slurring way, for his mind scarcely seemed to touch that point, so smoothly did it glide to another
returned Lizzie, in some confusion
returned the little creature, with a flush suffusing her face
they were sitting side by side as they had sat at first
Eugene suggested languidly -- for he was growing weary of the person of the house
said the little creature, resting one arm upon the elbow of her chair, resting her chin upon that hand, and looking vacantly before her
cried the little creature, holding out her hand and looking upward
in a tone as though it were ages ago
observed Eugene, quite ready to profit by the hint
cried the person of the house, pointing her little finger
pursued the person of the house
said the person of the house, terrifying him by a grand muster of her spirits and forces before recurring to the emphatic word
retorted the person of the house, speaking with vehement sharpness
said the person of the house, tapping the table near her in a business-like manner, and shaking her head and her chin
she returned, coming out of a deep study
says Veneering, not previously aware of having any
urges Twemlow with great nicety, as if; in the case of its having been off the whole, he would have done it directly
pursues Podsnap, becoming handsomely mollified
says Brewer, with a deeply mysterious countenance
says Mrs Veneering, looking about her for her pocket-handkerchief
said Mrs Lammle, holding up a forefinger
explained Miss Podsnap in a flutter
said the happy and fond Sophronia, smiling
remonstrated Mr Lammle, becoming graver
said Mrs Lammle, always laughing in her most captivating way
said Fascination Fledgeby, with great quickness of repartee
said Mr Lammle, low and smiling, and sparkling all over, like a harlequin
said Mr Lammle, raising his voice a little
remarked Mrs Lammle aside to her dear girl
said Mrs Lammle, stealing her affectionate hand towards her dear girl's
replied Mr Lammle, interpreting for her
replied Mrs Lammle, interpreting for him, and patting the back of her dear girl's hand, as if it were Fledgeby who was patting it
expressing more feeling as if it were more feeling on the part of Fledgeby
he asked, stopping very short, to prevent himself from running on into
said Mrs Lammle, charmed by the discovery which flowed from the premises
said Fascination Fledgeby, calmly feeling for his whisker
returned Fledgeby, with an internal chuckle
replied Fledgeby, with another internal chuckle
proceeded Fledgeby, with the greatest reluctance
said Fledgeby, eating his bread and butter
said Fledgeby, not at all pleased to be reminded of his having forgotten it
said Mr Lammle, looking fiercely about him
exclaimed Lammle, stopping and making the most of his chest
repeated Fledgeby, with laborious explanatory politeness
said he, throwing himself into a chair
he said sneakingly, when that was done
the old man represented with a grave and patient air
returned the old man with quiet emphasis
he resumed, as though it were he who had spoken last
said Fledgeby, looking at him as if he would like to try the effect of extracting a double-tooth or two
with a lithe sweep of his easily-turning hand around him, to comprehend the various objects on the shelves
thought Fledgeby, 'and a good
continued Fledgeby in a grudging vein, as he got off the stool
retorted Fledgeby, with his eyes on Riah's beard as he felt for his own
resumed the old man, motioning towards Lizzie
pursued the Jew, with an evident purpose of drawing out the dressmaker
said Fledgeby, on whose intelligence this doll-fancy made rather strong demands
said Fledgeby, poking into the contents of the basket with his forefinger
said Fledgeby, turning to the other visitor
said the little creature, pointing at him
observed Fledgeby, with a dry whistle
said Eugene, on one side of the fire
returned his friend, lazily lifting his head a little to look at him
said Eugene, getting out of his chair with much gravity
sitting on his bed, with the air of a philosopher lecturing a disciple
murmured Eugene, with the air of one who was meditating deeply
resumed Mortimer, disregarding the light interruption, and laying a hand upon Eugene's shoulder, as he, Mortimer, stood before him seated on his bed
returned Eugene, after a serious pause of a few moments
said Eugene, taking another little piece of earth, and shooting it with great precision at the former mark
said Eugene, taking, as he said the word, another shot
said Eugene, attracted by the sound of footsteps, and glancing down as he spoke
said Bradley, answering him with pale and quivering lips
replied Eugene, enjoying his cigar
interposed Eugene, striking sharply and cutting him short at his mistake
answered Bradley, with his passion rising
pursued the boy, forced into the use of the third person by the hopelessness of addressing him in the first
said Eugene, removing his fast- waning cigar from his lips to glance at it
added the boy, with a burning face, under the flaming aggravation of getting no sort of answer or attention
said Bradley, with his clutching hand
cried Bradley, breaking off to wipe the starting perspiration from his face as he shook from head to foot
returned Eugene, with a languid approach to impatience as the other again struggled with himself
said Eugene, as he lighted another cigar
replied Mortimer, still pacing the room
said Eugene, looking after him dubiously as he paced away to the other end of the room
said Lightwood, affectionately, now standing near him, so that they both stood in one little cloud of smoke
returned Eugene, lightly fanning away the smoke with his hand for the better exposition of his frankness of face and manner
Silas would say to his patron, sadly nodding his head and musing
whose very names were of his own inventing
said Silas, when the bargain was closed
says Venus, politely handing it over
says Venus, reddening and growing something louder
pursues Silas, with an oratorical flourish of his pipe and his wooden leg: the latter having an undignified tendency to tilt him back in his chair
replies Venus, winking his weak eyes, and running his fingers through his dusty shock of hair
says Wegg when the other has acted on his hospitable entreaty
says Wegg, holding Mr Venus's palm out, flat and ready for smiting, and now smiting it
cries Wegg; and the apostrophe is not the less impressive for the Being's hand being actually upon his rum and water
slowly returns that practical anatomist, after drinking
says Mr Venus, looking up, after meditating with his hair held in his hands, as if he could only fix his attention by fixing his head
remarks Wegg, when he is fully gone
says Mr Venus, gazing upward with his hat tumbling off
said Miss Bella, with an airy toss of her head
repeated Mr Boffin, with a shake of his head, after again thinking it over
said the Secretary, encountering her by chance alone in the great drawing-room
said Bella, looking at him as if he had reproved her
said Mrs Wilfer, presenting a cheek to be kissed, as sympathetic and responsive as the back of the bowl of a spoon
returned Lavinia, coolly, tossing her head
said Bella, with one beat of her foot
resumed Mrs Wilfer, directing her observations to her elder daughter, as safer on the whole than her utterly unmanageable younger
cried Mrs Wilfer, lifting up her eyes and apostrophising the air
said Mrs Wilfer, rising with stately resignation as she shook her head and dried her eyes
again dropping his voice in deference to the chariot
said Bella, who had already taken him by the chin, pulled his hat off, and begun to stick up his hair in her old way
her father delicately hinted, with a glance out at window
said Bella, hugging him close
he added, after a moment's reflection
the cherub pursued mildly and without a notion of complaining
added Bella, laughing as she pointed a rallying finger at his face
observed R. W., with some trepidation of manner
said Bella, rolling up the purse when they were alone again, hammering it small with her little fist on the table, and cramming it into one of the pockets of his new waistcoat
said Mrs Boffin, hoping that she saw her opportunity, and laying her hand persuasively on her arm
pursued the sweet compassionate soul, holding the hand kindly
returned Betty, fervently kissing the comforting hand
said that worthy soul, taking her comfortable place on a large ottoman in the centre of the room, and drawing her arm through Bella's
murmured Mr Boffin, in an admiring parenthesis
repeated Mrs Boffin, cordially beaming under the influence of her husband's compliment
said Mr Boffin, gravely propounding a case for his Secretary's opinion
said Bella; and perhaps she said it with some little sensitiveness arising out of those old curious relations of hers towards the murdered man
returned Mrs Boffin, giving her a squeeze
added Sloppy, after a moment's apologetic reflection
said Miss Peecher, as she sat making up her weekly report on a half-holiday afternoon
pursued Miss Peecher, complacent in her little transparent fiction of conducting the examination in a semiofficial manner for Mary Anne's benefit, not her own
said Miss Peecher, pondering on it; but smoothly added, in a confirmatory tone
pursued Bradley, laying his door-key on the table
returned Miss Peecher, though not aloud
thought that sharp young personage
returned Miss Wren, snapping her fingers in a volley of impatient snaps
pursued Miss Wren, doing so, and making two little dabs at him in the air with her needle, as if she pricked him with it in his own eyes
pursued Bradley, half humouring what was present, and half angry with what was not present
said the knowing Miss Wren
began Bradley, with a mouth so dry that he had some difficulty in articulating his words: the consciousness of which rendered his manner still more ungainly and undecided
returned the schoolmaster, stealing another look at her, and seeming to try in vain to sustain it; for the look dropped as it lighted on her eyes
said Bradley, with his uneasy look wandering to the doll, and unconsciously resting there longer than it had rested on Lizzie
she resumed, as though it were an after-thought
said Bradley Headstone, grinding his words slowly out, as though they came from a rusty mill
he pursued, after a pause, furtively wrenching at the seat of his chair with one hand, as if he would have wrenched the chair to pieces, and gloomily observing her while her eyes were cast down
said Lizzie, shaking her head
returned Pleasant, dropping her arms
were her hospitable words when she had got him in
returned the man, with a ruminative air, as he drew his right hand across his chin, and dipped the other in the pocket of his rough outer coat
returned the man, with a grim smile; and added, in a mutter
said the man, more seriously
said Mr Riderhood, quailing a little
returned Mr Riderhood, in the same sharp tone
muttered Mr Riderhood, slowly relaxing into a dark smile
said the stranger, in an exasperatingly comfortable sort of confidence
growled Mr Riderhood, rising to his feet, goaded to stand at bay
he added, turning to his daughter, as he filled the footless glass
returned the man, sternly shaking his head
getting, as he spoke, between the visitor and the door
returned the other, with impatience
said the visitor, whom the consideration rendered so uneasy that he rose, and paced to and fro, muttering
said the visitor, taking very little heed of this oration
entreated Pleasant, from the door, with her disengaged hand nervously trembling at her lips
said the sneaking Mr Riderhood, falling out of his path
said the man, in a tone which seemed to leave some such words as
said Bella, taking up her work, and inspecting it all round the corners
returned Bella, with a burning face
said Bella, taking refuge in a touch of timely resentment
said Bella with a little sting of self-reproach
proceeded Bella with increasing spirit
he proceeded, when their eyes met
said Bella, raising her eyes to his, after a little struggle to forbear
retorted Bella, with her old indignation rising
said R. W. in the warmth of his heart
urged the cherub, a little remonstrant against the very decisive and unpitying tone
said the old creature simply
added the Secretary, as a comfort for her
said Betty, with logical good faith
he asked, again trying to make a diversion
said Bradley, after casting his eyes on the ground
said the Secretary, quietly going back to the point
replied Bradley, very restlessly indeed
said Bradley, separating his words over-carefully, and speaking as if he were repeating them from a book
said Rokesmith, when they all stood about her, while she packed her tidy basket -- except Bella, who was busily helping on her knees at the chair on which it stood
returned his sister, detaining his hand as he withdrew it
he said, always speaking passionately, and, when most emphatic, repeating that former action of his hands, which was like flinging his heart's blood down before her in drops upon the pavement-stones
striking himself upon the breast
he said, with his attention apparently engrossed by it
said he, suddenly changing his tone and turning to her, and bringing his clenched hand down upon the stone with a force that laid the knuckles raw and bleeding
he went on, folding his hands before him, clearly to prevent his being betrayed into any impetuous gesture
returned Lizzie, with a burning face
she replied through her starting tears
cried the boy, contemptuously throwing her off again
said the boy, taking no heed of the remonstrance, and pursuing his own mortified disappointment
said the boy in a violent tone
with a look at Riah
said Eugene, who soon found this fatiguing
replied the old man, calmly
he returned, in a low voice, bending over her on the other side
said Eugene, when they were left together in the street
says Lightwood, glancing round the table
he corrects himself with the addition
with a glance at Eugene
cried Fascination, in his light raillery
he said, taking one up to eye it closely
returned the old man, looking over his master's shoulder
said that fascinating gentleman, wiping his eyes again
repeated Lammle, with a sweep of his right arm
suggested Fledgeby, after reflecting with a very discontented brow
remarked Fledgeby, with his hands in the Turkish trousers
said Lammle, in a bullying tone
repeated Fledgeby with a peculiar relish
urged Fledgeby, in a submissive tone
here he rubbed the places where they were due
proceeded Fledgeby, when he had had his laugh out
said Fledgeby, when the Jew had put it in his pocketbook, and was putting that in the breast of his outer garment
retorted Fledgeby, with some slight tinge of a blush
said Fledgeby, meeting his eyes with a wink
pursued Fledgeby, feeling for his whisker
resumed Miss Wren with great approbation
here the little creature glanced back over her shoulder at the sky
said Miss Wren thoughtfully, by no means convinced, and chopping the exclamation with that sharp little hatchet of hers
she added with the quaint hitch of her chin and eyes
said the old man, with courteous action
Miss Jenny struck in, flushed
muttered Miss Wren, inaudibly, with a visible hitch of her chin
said Miss Abbey Potterson, when she had read it several times, and thought about it
Miss Abbey made proclamation, in her most commanding tones
said she, turning to her two companions
moralizes Tom Tootle with a gloomy shake of the head
says Miss Abbey, cheering them up
thinks Pleasant with a sigh
says the doctor, gravely shaking his head
interposed Lavvy, over the maternal shoulder
said Bella, reappearing in the kitchen with some remains of a blush
returned Bella, merrily searching in a dresser-drawer
said Bella, pushing back her hair from her temples with both hands
said Mrs Wilfer with a wave of her gloves, expressive of abdication under protest from the culinary throne
said Mr George Sampson, who had meditated this neat address while coming along
said Bella, as she watched the carving of the fowls
pursued Mrs Wilfer in an oratorical manner
retorted Mrs Wilfer, with an awful look, and in an awful tone
said Mrs Wilfer, deepening her voice, as if she were relating a terrible ghost story
he said, as if she had spoken
Bella laid the little forefinger of her right glove on her lip, and then laid it on her father's lip
she was confused here in spite of her merry way of beginning
her father felt himself bound to echo
said her father, with his hand to his eyes
said the Golden Dustman, so sharply rapping the table to bespeak his attention as Bella turned the leaves of her book, that she started
returned the Secretary, with an air of some reluctance and a glance towards those others who were present
said Mrs Boffin, with her work abandoned, her eyes upon the fire, and her chin upon her hand
said Mr Boffin, dropping his voice and glancing towards the door with an apprehension of being overheard by some eavesdropper there
said Mrs Boffin, with a worried look
said Mrs Boffin, still with that distressed expression
said Bella, sternly putting the question to herself in the looking-glass as usual
Mr Boffin would say, checking Bella's arm at a bookseller's window
said Mrs Lammle one day in the chariot
returned Sophronia, shaking her head, and smiling her best smile
said Mrs Lammle, rallying her with an arch look and her best smile
returned Bella, tossing her head
said Mr Boffin one evening when they were all in his room again, and he and the Secretary had been going over some accounts
said Mr Boffin, with a look of peculiar shrewdness
said Mr Wegg, in excellent spirits
said Mr Wegg, in a hospitable glow
observed the last-named gentleman, rubbing his knees peevishly
said Mr Wegg, extending his right hand with an air of solemn reasoning
said Mr Wegg, with an air of patient injury
cried Mr Boffin in a bustle
repeated Mr Boffin, continuing to muse and survey the books
replied Silas, adjusting his spectacles, and referring to the title-page
repeated Silas, reading very distinctly
observed Wegg, with a propitiatory face to draw him out, and with another peg at his friend and brother
replied Wegg, consulting the text
said Venus, keeping watch upon his dusky figure all the time
he said, after having sunk into a moody silence, with his hands clasped behind him, and his eyes suspiciously wandering about Wegg
said Wegg, at length breaking the silence
pursued Wegg, pointing his words with his forefinger
returned Wegg, with a sort of joyful affability
added Wegg, benignantly taking him by both hands again, and clapping him on both knees again
returned Wegg with considerable reluctance
said Wegg, even more insinuatingly than before
said Wegg, after a silence, during which they had contemplated one another
said Venus, blowing at his tea in his saucer, and looking over it at his confidential friend
said Wegg, when this happy understanding was established
replied Mr Venus with a comical mixture of indignant obstinacy and tender melancholy
exclaimed Wegg with a sigh, but eyeing him while pretending to keep him company in eyeing the fire
rejoined Venus, and then stopped to swallow more tea
said Venus, taking another gulp of tea and mournfully winking at the fire
he said in a tone of friendly commiseration
said some farmers standing by, who had come out from their market-dinner
said the Deputy Lock, shrugging his shoulders with his hands in his pockets, and shaking his head in a sulkily ominous manner
said the Deputy, with deliberation
said the Deputy Lock, cunningly harping on the strong string of her terror
he said, with an abstracted air, after a little meditation
said the Deputy, counting the money with his eyes
said the Deputy, giving her back the letter, and pocketing the coins, one by one
said Betty Higden, holding up her withered hands
said the Reverend Frank Milvey, brushing his hand across his eyes
observed her husband in parenthesis
said Mrs Milvey, aside to the Reverend Frank
said the Reverend Frank aside to his good little wife
said Bella, excusing and explaining herself in a pretty shy way
said the Secretary in a lower voice
said the Secretary, with the shadow so long on him quite thrown off and cast away
returned Bella, with a look as if she italicized the word by putting one of her dimples under it
returned Bella, again italicizing with the dimple
added the Secretary after a moment
said the Secretary, with a beaming face
said Bella, with a charming air of being inclined to give herself up as a bad job
said Bella, looking at him with curiosity, as not quite making him out
said Bella, turning away her eyes
returned the Secretary, with the same steady look
said Bella, drawing her chair a little nearer, and taking Lizzie's arm as if they were going out for a walk
said Bella, quite amazing herself by the business-like manner in which she was getting on
observed Bella, returning to her subject when she had administered this chastisement
said Bella, with a pettish whimper
inquired Lizzie with her quiet smile, the hair being now secured
said Bella, stopping short as she glanced at him
replied Miss Wren, pricking at him in the air with her needle
exclaimed Miss Wren, attracted by the sound of his chattering teeth
said Miss Wren, rating him with great severity
said Miss Wren, taking away her hand after a little while, and laughing satirically to hide that she had been crying
returned Miss Wren with a hitch of her chin
said Jenny, shaking her head and her emphatic little forefinger at her burden
remarked Eugene coolly, after watching him for some minutes
returned the debtor, very composedly taking up his glass
said Eugene, pausing in setting down his glass
remarked Eugene with much gravity
observed Eugene, turning round to the furniture
pursued Eugene, as Lightwood stared at the obscene visitor
said Mr Dolls, trying to smite himself on the breast, but bringing his hand to bear upon the vicinity of his eye
urged Lightwood in a low voice, as he complied
was the reply, made with that former gleam of determination
said Mr Dolls, with majesty
said Eugene; adding very heartily under his breath
said Mortimer, after lighting a cigar, and comforting himself with a whiff or two
said Wrayburn, answering the look and smiling carelessly
returned Eugene with the calmest indifference
said Eugene with a light laugh
the watchman explained, showing it in his hand
the man assented in a surly way
returned the man, pointing backward over his right shoulder with his right thumb
said Bradley, with a frown and a distant look before him
returned the man in a tone of injured innocence
replied Mr Riderhood, mollified and mysterious
cried Mr Riderhood, with a hoarse laugh
growled Mr Riderhood, winding up his monotonous summary of his wrongs
said he, after a pause, during which they walked on side by side
said Riderhood, faring on again
when he had carefully pocketed the coins on that side of himself which was furthest from his new friend
returned Bradley with quivering lips
said Mr Riderhood, evasively, for he was substituting those words for
which was the phrase really in his mind
said Bradley Headstone, after some more discourse to this effect
said Mrs Lammle to the skeleton
said Mr Lammle to the skeleton
she said, looking up with some timidity into his face
he resumed, after a fruitless silence
she resumed, with a bitter stress upon the phrase
observed Lammle, changing the leg on which he stood
she asked, in the same cold plotting way
said Lammle, with a crooked smile
cried Lammle, shrugging his shoulders
said Mrs Lammle, giving him a very gracious reception
remarked Mr Fledgeby, trying a new part of his chair
Mr Fledgeby began, and there stuck so long for a word to get on with, that Mrs Lammle offered him sweetly
Mrs Lammle went on in a very interesting manner
returned Fledgeby, who never would, under any circumstances, accept a suggested expression
was Mr Fledgeby's commentary delivered with a wink
said Mr Fledgeby, shutting up one eye
added Mr Fledgeby, after casting about for an expressive phrase
remarked Fledgeby, a little louder than before
said Fledgeby, with a very disparaging utterance of his name
said Fledgeby, putting his hands in his pockets and counterfeiting deep meditation
proceeded Fledgeby with an ill-favoured glance
said Fledgeby, appearing to pluck up his spirits
said the old man, with great uneasiness
said Fledgeby, with peculiar unction
said the old man in a whisper, and with a worn-out look
observed Venus, after clutching at his dusty hair, to brighten his ideas
the penitent anatomist went on
but, unwilling to press too hard upon himself, substituted with great emphasis
said Mr Boffin, with a hearty grip of his hand
he by- and-by resumed, nervously sitting down again
insinuated Mr Boffin, after looking at the fire for a while
said Venus, stoutly and shortly
said Mr Boffin, grumbling over the fire in an injured manner
said he, with a gleam of hope
said that gentleman in a sprightly manner
he slowly and unwillingly admitted, in his reluctance to loose his hold
said Mr Wegg, greatly exasperated
said Wegg, falling back upon his strongest terms of reprobation, and slapping the counter
he meditated as he went along, nursing his stick
Mrs Lammle called to her coachman
returned the Secretary, as, having closed the door, he turned and faced him
said Mr Boflin, anticipating his wife
here Mr Boffin clapped a finger against his nose, and tapped it several times with a sneaking air, as embodying Rokesmith confidentially confabulating with his own nose
retorted Mr Boffin, with a sly look
remarked the Secretary, waving the point aside with his hand
said her husband, but without harshness
said the Secretary, in a low voice
pursued the Secretary, without deigning to notice him
the Secretary went on, still without heeding him
remarked the Secretary, looking full at his late master
asked Mr Boffin, turning to his wife in a bantering tone
said the Secretary, turning from him and falling into his former manner
Rokesmith answered as he took it from the ground
retorted Mr Boffin, with ineffable contempt
said Rokesmith, quietly turning to her
said Mr Boffin, laying his hand on Bella's head again
cried Bella, turning suddenly upon him, with a stamp of her little foot
said Bella, returning to the charge
proceeded Bella, breaking into tears again
the Golden Dustman slowly remonstrated
cried Bella, rising hurriedly again
said Mr Boffin, holding it out in a stolid manner
he said, as he spread it on another piece of paper before her
said Bella, moving coaxingly to his side instead of remaining opposite
returned the cherub, looking at them both
said John Rokesmith, excitedly and joyfully
replied the cherub, still pathetically scared
pursued the cherub, enjoining patience with his hand
the cherub went on in a glowing voice, as Bella's hand stole gradually up his waistcoat to his neck
said the cherub, looking round the office with unspeakable enjoyment
said her father, after some slight hesitation
said her father, with much gentleness
said the cherub gaily, and not expressing disapproval
the cherub hinted at last
said Bella, when she became visible
the cherub faltered, with something of a craven air
cried Bella, putting out her right foot
said Bella, taking him by both ears as if he were a pitcher, and conveying his face to her rosy lips
said Bella, taking off the depreciated bonnet and shaking out her hair
said Miss Lavvy, in a sepulchral, warning voice, founded on her mother's
said Bella in due course
said Miss Lavinia in her voice of warning
said Lavinia with a toss of her chin
said Miss Lavinia which might not have been supposed at the moment
here Miss Lavinia checked herself in a bounce, and added more placidly
returned Lavvy, folding her arms and leaning back in her chair
returned her father, in the simplest good faith
exclaimed Bella; then putting out her small white bare foot
says Mrs Lammle, with a certain hardened manner upon her, that makes Twemlow shrink
says the uneasy little gentleman
says Mrs Lammle, fixing her eyes on his face, to enforce what she says herself
says Mrs Lammle, raising her eyes to his face again, and quite daunting him with her hardened manner
says Mrs Lammle, fixing his eyes with hers: which he would prevent her doing if he could, but he can't
says Mrs Lammle, coldly and boldly, and with some disdain
quoth Mrs Lammle, glancing haughtily at the Snigsworth portrait, and shaking out her dress before departing
Mrs Lammle answers, stopping, and sketching out the pattern of the paper on the wall with the point of her parasol
says Brewer in a favourable pause
replies Brewer, looking about for anybody else to address his answer to, and giving the preference to Lightwood
says the Father of the three hundred and seventy-five thousand pounds
says that discreet young gentleman, standing on tiptoe to whisper
said Riderhood, smiting his right leg, and laughing, as he sat on the grass
said Bradley, whose surprise had a genuine air
returned Riderhood, with a wink and shake of his head
with another anxious look up the river
repeated Riderhood, with an angry oath
said Bradley, with an effort at self-repression that forced him to wipe his face
answered Riderhood, with sullen ferocity
said Bradley, with a clutch at the breast of his coarse shirt
retorted Riderhood, completely ridding himself of his grass, and drawing his sleeve across his mouth
pursued Bradley, waving the interruption aside with an impatient hand
said Riderhood, shaking his head with an air of thorough conviction
asked Riderhood, after watching him for a while with a sidelong glance
muttered Riderhood at the Lock-house door, looking after him
at intervals all day, and
he stopped as though he were suffocating, and began again
he said, in a low, calm voice
muttered Riderhood in a lower and a different voice
he murmured in a low tone, with a crafty face, and a very watchful eye and ready foot, lest he should start up
urged the lady, tenderly moved
said Mr Lammle, soaring into a tone of moral grandeur
asked Mrs Lammie, therefore, with an innocent air, of Mr and Mrs Boffin
said Mrs Lammle, still gaily
said the airy Mrs Lammle therefore
said Mr Boffin softly, taking out a pocket-book
said Mr Boffin, addressing Alfred
assented Alfred, with a glittering smile and a great deal of nose
pursued Mr Boffin, addressing Sophronia
returned Mrs Lammle, with a scornful look and in a loud voice
said Alfred, smiling assent as before
her husband repeated in a bantering manner
said Mr Boffin, with his voice still dropped
cried Georgiana, wringing her hands as she ran up to embrace her
said Georgiana, sobbing and drying her face, and then searching in a little reticule
said Mr Boffin, showing the money and the necklace
said Mrs Lammle, still sketching, and seeming to bestow great pains upon it
remarked that man of might, addressing him
returned Mr Boffin, with folded hands
said Wegg, with one arm a-kimbo and his head on one side, like a bullying counsel pausing for an answer from a witness
said Wegg, stumping back into the room again, a little reddened by his late exertion
said Silas Wegg, pointing out Venus
returned Mr Boffin, leaning forward in alarmed appeal, with his hands on his knees
cried that unfortunate gentleman again
said Wegg, turning to his partner with a knowing and superior air
said Silas, taking off his coat
said Mr Boffin, in a tone of despondency
returned Wegg, shaking his head sagaciously, and bestowing a wooden wink upon him
said Wegg, contemptuously, though, perhaps, perceiving some hint of danger otherwise
whispered Bella, after greeting him with a hug
asked Bella, laughing (notwithstanding her repentance), with fantastic pleasure in the picture
said the Archbishop in a low stately voice
said his Grace, returning alone
said Mrs Wilfer from her stately corner
he returned, with a most flagrant assumption of unconsciousness
hinted the cherub, as he folded the letter after a disconcerting silence
Mr Sampson remonstrated, shaking his head seriously
said Lavvy, with a melancholy smile
said Mrs Wilfer, making deep proclamation from her corner
Mr Sampson hardly seemed to like that word
here turning to her husband
again turning to her husband
again turning to her husband
said Mrs Wilfer, resuming her discourse and turning to her lord again
after a short pause, and an air of having taken medicine in it
said Mrs Wilfer, with solemn indignation
cried Bella, running into the room with a radiant face
here her eyes sparkled more brightly
said her husband, smiling, as he stood by her side, without her having detected his approach
said John, with a very expressive look of admiration around him
said Bella, looking up into his face
said Bella, glancing downward at the feet in question
said Bella, taking him by a button of his coat
replied the cherub, smiling and rubbing his hands as she sat him down in his chair
said the cherub, after a little consideration
said Bella, looking at her father's hand and lightly slapping it
cried Bella, taking him by the front of his coat
he softly asked her with his lips to hers
cried her husband, rallying her
said Bella, twisting the button and shaking her head
said Bella, occupied with the button
said Eugene, after taking some half-dozen turns
said he, in an easy way though ill at ease with himself
for, his arm was coming about her again
said Lizzie, fixing her eyes upon him with the look of supplication which troubled his better nature
she answered, suddenly breaking into tears
she answered resolutely, though trembling
he struck in, skilfully changing the form of words
she replied appealingly, and weeping
said Eugene, calling after him
said Riderhood, squinting at his Lock, when he saw Bradley coming out of the house
returned Riderhood, in a cheerful, affable, and conversational manner
said Riderhood, with a hitch of his head, as if he disdainfully jerked the feint away
said Riderhood, turning on his heel
he said in a feeling manner
was his debate with himself
said Riderhood then, still following
said good Miss Peecher with a little sad sigh which she repressed by laying her hand on her neat methodical boddice
said Bradley, trying to constrain his working mouth
said the boy, advancing a step as he lowered his voice
said young Hexam, shaking his head in a half-threatening manner
he went on, actually with tears
Miss Wren would say to him, with a menacing forefinger
inquired the dressmaker, bending over the doll on which her art was being exercised
was Miss Wren's cool answer
said Miss Jenny, holding out her doll at arm's length, and critically contemplating the effect of her art with her scissors on her lips and her head thrown back, as if her interest lay there, and not in the conversation
remarked Miss Wren, in a sprightly tone
returned the dressmaker with many knowing nods
returned the dressmaker, with her eyes upon her work
Mr Fledgeby's constructive powers were not equal to the avoidance of some tautology here
he had a very bad time of it; which was not made better by his being so remorseful as frequently to moan
whimpered Mr Fledgeby, groaning and writhing again
said Miss Jenny with a silent laugh
replied Miss Wren, sitting down beside the Jew
responded the old man, with gravity
began the old man gently
cried the little creature, wildly beating her hands together
she would reply with a shrug
said Miss Jenny, as she stood upon a chair to look at the result in the glass
with a sob, and wiping her eyes
said Miss Jenny, shaking her forefinger
said Eugene, with something of his old look
said John, taking her on his knee
pursued Bella, pouting a little more
returned her husband, with a look of pride in her
said Bella, laughing a little
said John Rokesmith, touching her cheek, with a grave smile, as she cast down her eyes and pouted again
said Bella with a steady countenance
said Mr Milvey, with a smile
returned Eugene with a smile
said Eugene, after a while
said Eugene, again shaking his head
she said, cheerily reverting to their former conversation
observed her husband, not avoiding his eye, but looking at him
said Lightwood to Bella, delicately
said Lightwood hesitating, with another glance towards Bella
which her anxious face confirmed
said Mr Inspector, in a business-like manner
retorted Mr Inspector, again using his pocket handkerchief
her husband was beginning; when Mr Inspector, regarding the words as an introduction, said
returned Mr Inspector in a comfortable sort of remonstrance
said Mr Inspector to John, turning the gas lower
said Mr Inspector (again, a subject which nobody had approached
Mr Inspector went on slowly, with his eyes narrowly observant of the two guests
returned the Inexhaustible, administering more punishment
said Bella, flushed in quite a lovely manner by these exercises
said Mr Boffin, at length
says Mrs Boffin, breaking off in the rush of her speech to smile most radiantly
returned Bella, with quivering lips
said Bella, looking vacantly from one to another
cried the comfortable creature, embracing her
with a hearty laugh and an embrace
returned Bella, giving him two pulls and one kiss
said Mr Boffin, one broad piece of sunshine from head to foot
said Bella, after this meditative pause
cried Bella, covering her face with her hands
said Venus, smiling in a sprightly manner
Wegg reluctantly demanded, constraining his ill temper in remembrance of the partnership and its stock in trade
observed Wegg, with a touch of distrust
said Wegg, after eyeing him with another touch of distrust
said the owner of the hand which had done this
said Wegg, with a snap of his fingers
said Wegg, dividing his next observation between Mr Boffin and Mr Harmon
replied Wegg, turning upon him with a severe air
neturned John Harmon, suiting his action to his words, with the heartiest good will
added John Harmon through his clenched teeth, and with a very ugly turn indeed on Wegg's cravat
said Mr Boffin, in his clemency
resumed Wegg, with a malignant glance in the last speaker's direction
said Mr Boffin uneasily, with his hand in his pocket
Mr Wegg went on, in a meditative manner
said Wegg with a melancholy air
said Riderhood, surveying the class
said Riderhood, 'with a person of about your own heighth and breadth, and wot
said Riderhood, with a laugh
pursued Riderhood, changing his hoarse tone and leering round upon the class again
said Bradley, always sustaining his dark look at the other, and speaking in his suppressed voice
said Riderhood, observing him out of the corners of his eyes
said Riderhood, smearing his sleeve across his mouth as he laughed with a relish
repeated Riderhood, in a louder voice
heavily smiting the table with great force
said Riderhood, snapping his fingers at him half a dozen times
said Lavvy, throwing herself back among the cushions, with her arms crossed
retorted Mrs Wilfer, with deep scorn
proceeded Mrs Wilfer, majestically waving her gloves
Mr Sampson explained, in exceedingly low spirits
observed Miss Lavinia, with much politeness
Mr Sampson slapped his forehead
Mr Sloppy couldn't make it out
said Sloppy, glancing at the array of dolls in hand
said Sloppy, in something of a self-reproachful tone
said Sloppy, surveying the room
said Sloppy, after measuring the handle on his sleeve, and softly standing the stick aside against the wall
she added as an afterthought, shrugging her shoulders
Eugene began with Lightwood, reaching up his hand
retorted Eugene, in his old airy manner, as he laughed and kissed her
says the charmer, exchanging salutations
says Podsnap, with his temper and his shirt-collar about equally rumpled
pursues Podsnap, with his indignation rising high into those hair-brushes of his
returns Podsnap, putting the thing away with his right arm
says Lightwood, in an uncompromising voice
says Twemlow, rather less mildly than usual
returns Twemlow, with his wristbands bristling a little
