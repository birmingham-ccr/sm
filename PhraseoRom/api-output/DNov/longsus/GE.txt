said the man, licking his lips
said the man, with a threatening shake of his head
said Joe, glancing up at the Dutch clock
said my sister, out of breath
said Joe, solemnly, with his last bite in his cheek and speaking in a confidential voice, as if we two were quite alone
he moved his chair and looked about the floor between us, and then again at me
said Joe, looking at me, and not at Mrs. Joe, with his bite still in his cheek
said I, when I had done my stirring, and was taking a final warm in the chimney corner before being sent up to bed
interposed my sister, frowning at me over her work
said I, as a last resort
I explained, trembling; "and - and" - I was very anxious to put this delicately
he had said all the rest, as if he had forgotten my being there
said Uncle Pumblechook: a large hard-breathing middle-aged slow man, with a mouth like a fish, dull staring eyes, and sandy hair standing upright on his head, so that he looked as if he had just been all but choked, and had that moment come to
returned Mr. Wopsle; and I knew he was going to lug me in, before he said it
pursued Mr. Wopsle, in his deepest voice, and pointing his fork at my blushes, as if he were mentioning my Christian name
assented Mr. Wopsle, rather irritably
said Mr. Pumblechook, turning sharp on me
returned Mr. Pumblechook, who had an objection to being interrupted
said Mr. Pumblechook, leading the company gently back to the theme from which they had strayed
said my sister, addressing the guests with her best grace
and I heard Joe say
said the sergeant, "but as I have mentioned at the door to this smart young shaver" (which he hadn't
said the sergeant, who had by this time picked out Joe with his eye
returned the sergeant, clapping him on the shoulder
and Joe whispered to me
and he made an emphatic swing at the ditch with his manacled hands
said the other convict then
said the sergeant to my convict
returned the sergeant, standing coolly looking at him with his arms folded
said my convict, turning his eyes on Joe in a moody manner, and without the least glance at me
cried Joe, opening his blue eyes wide
said Joe, looking at it with a slowly searching eye
he continued, after rubbing his knees a little, "when you do come to a J and a O, and says you
said Joe, with a judicial touch or two of the poker on the top bar
Joe looked firmly at me, as if he knew I was not going to agree with him
Joe tapped the top bar with the poker after every word following
Joe sank his voice to a whisper and glanced at the door
said Joe, passing the poker into his left hand, that he might feel his whisker; and I had no hope of him whenever he took to that placid occupation
said Joe, rising to replenish the fire
said my sister, shaking her head at me as an encouragement to be extremely light and sportive
in a tone of the deepest reproach, as if he were the most callous of nephews, "then mention this boy, standing Prancing here" - which I solemnly declare I was not doing
said my sister, still in a reproachful manner, while Joe apologetically drew the back of his hand across and across his nose
cried my sister, casting off her bonnet in sudden desperation
returned the young lady, who was very pretty and seemed very proud
with an impatient movement of the fingers of her right hand
and then triumphantly demanded, as if he had done for me
he returned, forced to the admission
said I, taking hold of his rolled-up shirt sleeve, and twisting it between my finger and thumb
I replied, letting his shirt sleeve go, and sitting down in the ashes at his feet, hanging my head
said Joe, after some rumination
added Joe, with a shake of the head that was full of meaning
said the strange man, turning to Joe
observed Joe, by way of introducing Mr. Wopsle
said Joe, meditatively - not, of course, that it could be in anywise necessary to consider about it, but because it was the way at the Jolly Bargemen to seem to consider deeply about everything that was discussed over pipes
said Joe, with the same appearance of profound cogitation
and Camilla add, with indignation
said he, biting the side of his great forefinger as he frowned at me
she said, without being startled or surprised
said she, pointing at the door behind me with her withered hand
said she, pointing to the long table with her stick
she asked me, again pointing with her stick
observed the grave lady whose voice I had heard but once
added Miss Sarah Pocket (a blandly vicious personage
striking the table with her stick
stabbing with her crutched stick at the pile of cobwebs on the table but not touching it
said she, with a ghastly look
Joe now observed in a manner that was at once expressive of forcible argumentation, strict confidence, and great politeness
returned Joe, strengthening his former mixture of argumentation, confidence, and politeness
replied Joe, as if that were a little unreasonable
said Miss Havisham, as she looked them over
returned Joe, cutting me short as if he were hurt
said Joe, conveying to me a sensation, first of burning and then of freezing, for I felt as if that familiar expression were applied to Miss Havisham
here Joe showed that he felt he had fallen into frightful difficulties, until he triumphantly rescued himself with the words
said Joe, with a fixed look at me, like an effort of remembrance
pursued Joe, with another fixed look at me, like another effort of remembrance
added Joe, with an appearance of reflection
said Joe, delightedly handing the bag to my sister
echoed that basest of swindlers, Pumblechook, rising to shake hands with her
said Pumblechook, as he took me by the arm above the elbow
said my sister (grasping the money
Joe pursued, as soon as he was past that danger
said Joe, still harping on it as though I had particularly pressed it
said Joe, steadfastly impressing it upon me, as if he were endeavouring to rouse me from a fixed delusion
I cried, in desperation, taking hold of his coat
Joe assented, as if he had been contending for that, all along
growled the journeyman, between his teeth
she cried suddenly, turning herself and her chair towards me
said Mr. Wopsle, exalted with his late performance
I observed, when I had done turning it over
said I, after binding her to secrecy
said I, with some severity
said Biddy, quietly raising her eyebrows
said I, plucking up more grass and chewing a blade or two
I cried, getting up, putting my arm round her neck, and giving her a kiss
said I, when we were walking homeward
she replied, glancing over her shoulder as he slouched after us
said Biddy, glancing over her shoulder again
as the victim, and he barbarously bellowed
said the stranger to Mr. Wopsle, when the reading was done
Mr. Wopsle began to reply
pursued the stranger in his most sarcastic and suspicious manner
pursued the gentleman, throwing his finger at Mr. Wopsle heavily
said he, looking round at us as we all quailed before him
said Mr. Jaggers, throwing his finger at me sideways
he interrupted, shaking his head and frowning and smiling both at once
said Mr. Jaggers, swinging his purse
returned Joe, still looking at the fire, and holding his knees tight, as if he had private information that they intended to make off somewhere
I returned with some resentment
I went on, after we had shaken hands
said Joe, in a comfortable tone
said Biddy, looking full at me and shaking her head
said I, in a virtuous and superior tone
said I, casually drawing some guineas out of my pocket and looking at them
I added - otherwise I thought he might only pretend to make them
said Mr. Trabb, as he respectfully bent his body, opened his arms, and took the liberty of touching me on the outside of each elbow
said Mr. Trabb, with the greatest sternness
said Mr. Trabb, taking down a roll of cloth, and tiding it out in a flowing manner over the counter, preparatory to getting his hand under it to show the gloss
said Mr. Trabb to the boy after that
said Mr. Pumblechook, taking me by both hands, when he and I and the collation were alone
said Mr. Pumblechook, after snorting admiration at me for some moments
and Mr. Pumblechook took me by both hands again, and communicated a movement to his waistcoat, which had an emotional appearance, though it was rather low down
said Mr. Pumblechook, getting up again the moment after he had sat down
said Mr. Pumblechook, getting up again
said Mr. Pumblechook, apostrophizing the fowl in the dish
said Mr. Pumblechook, getting up again
he resumed, after a little steady eating
cried Mr. Pumblechook, leaning back in his chair, quite flaccid with admiration
said the servile Pumblechook, putting down his untasted glass in a hurry and getting up again
I was exceedingly careful what I said
cried my excitable acquaintance, turning white
said Mr. Jaggers, turning to the man, who was pulling a lock of hair in the middle of his forehead, like the Bull in Cock Robin pulling at the bell-rope
returned Mike, in the voice of a sufferer from a constitutional cold
said Mike, wiping his nose on his fur cap this time
said he, throwing his forefinger at the terrified client
said my guardian, very sternly
said my guardian to the clerk, in extreme disgust
said my guardian, whose flask of sherry smelt like a whole cask-full, as he hastily refreshed himself
said the pale young gentleman, reaching out his hand goodhumouredly
said he, turning round as the door opened
said he, finally throwing off the story as it were
said he, leaning back in his chair
said he, putting his thumbs in his waistcoat pockets
cried one of the nurses to two of the children
she cried, picking up the pocket handkerchief
said Mrs. Pocket, looking off her book for a moment
returned Flopson, very red in the face
he added, with his son's smile
remonstrated Mr. Pocket, from the other end of the table
retorted Mr. Jaggers, lying in wait for me, with his hands in his pockets, his head on one side, and his eyes on the wall behind me
added Wemmick, bringing his pen to paper
said Mr. Wemmick, as we came out
said I, as the two odious casts with the twitchy leer upon them caught my sight again
and if anybody made an admission, he said
I hardly felt complimented by the word
proceeded Wemmick, after a moment's pause, as if the remark followed on the housekeeper understood
said Wemmick, cutting me short
said Wemmick, smiling again, but seriously too, as he shook his head
said Wemmick, shaking hands with him in a cordial and jocose way
said Wemmick, contemplating the old man, with his hard face really softened
giving him a tremendous one
giving him a still more tremendous one
said Wemmick then, as he laid down his pipe
said he, putting his large hand on my shoulder and moving me to the window
said Mr. Jaggers, not looking at her, but obstinately looking at the opposite side of the room
said Mr. Jaggers, giving her a slight nod
I went on, meaning to be very severe
said Mr. Jaggers, deliberately putting down the glass, and hauling out his gold repeater by its massive chain
said he, sluicing his face, and speaking through the water-drops
Joe considered a little before he discovered this word
said Joe, lowering his voice
said Joe, getting the bird's-nest under his left arm for the moment and groping in it for an egg with his right
said Joe, "which I hope as you and Pip" - here his eye fell on the Avenger, who was putting some toast on table, and so plainly denoted an intention to make that young gentleman one of the family, that I frowned it down and confused him more
said Joe, stiff from head to foot
returned Joe, evidently dispirited by the proposal
added Joe, in an explanatory manner
said Joe, with his old air of lucid exposition
whenever he subsided into affection, he called me Pip, and whenever he relapsed into politeness he called me Sir
said Joe, going down a new track
said Joe, slightly tossing his head
said Joe, looking at me as if I were a long way off
replied Joe, with an air of legal formality, as if he were making his will
said Joe, rising from his chair
pleaded the keeper to the angry passenger
said the other, with a bitter curse upon the cold
resumed the convict I had recognized
said I, not desirous of more conversation
he retorted, first stretching himself and then shaking himself
said Sarah, with a dismal shake of the head
I heard her say, immediately
Miss Havisham continued to mutter, without looking round or up
said I, rather at a loss
she added, in a haughty tone
said Estella, condescending to me as a brilliant and beautiful woman might
said Estella, not so much with a frown (for her brow was smooth) as with a darkening of her face
said she, in the same hurried passionate whisper
interposed Miss Havisham, much to my relief
said my guardian, comfortably satisfied beforehand on the general head
he observed, when I had concluded
said my guardian, making his pocket-handkerchief-point, with perfect confidence
said I, laying my hand upon his knee
said I, to whom this was a new and not unwelcome light
returned Herbert, smiling, and clapping his hand on the back of mine
Herbert replied, in his gay hopeful way
Herbert went on, as if we had been talking instead of silent
said I, with my head still turned away
said Herbert, getting up with a lively shake as if he had been asleep, and stirring the fire
said Herbert, who had become curiously crestfallen and meek, since we entered on the interesting theme
said the owner of that property
said Wemmick, touching me on the breast with his forefinger
said the man, unwilling to let his hand go
said the turnkey, who kept us between the two studded and spiked lodge gates, and who carefully locked one before he unlocked the other
said the turnkey, grinning again
cried Wemmick, suddenly hitting out at the turnkey in a facetious way
said Wemmick, gravely in my ear, as he took my arm to be more confidential
said Estella, nodding at me with an expression of face that was at once grave and rallying
said Estella, gliding away the instant I touched her cheek
said I, by way of putting it neatly on somebody else
said Estella, with a sigh, as if she were tired
says Herbert to me, coming home to dinner on one of those special occasions
as my local paper might put it
said Herbert, going out and coming back with it
Joe whispered me, as we were being what Mr. Trabb called "formed" in the parlour, two and two - and it was dreadfully like a preparation for some grim kind of dance
pursued Biddy, with a smile, as she raised her eyes to my face
said Biddy, laying her hand upon my arm, as I was for running out
said I, in a virtuously self-asserting manner
said I, when I gave her my hand at parting
my guardian began, as if I were a witness in the box
said Mr. Jaggers, bending forward to look at the ground, and then throwing his head back to look at the ceiling
repeated Mr. Jaggers, still looking at the ceiling
said I, after casting about for a precise form of words
replied Mr. Jaggers, fixing me for the first time with his dark deep-set eyes
said Mr. Jaggers, warming the backs of his legs with the backs of his warmed hands
said Mr. Jaggers, straightening himself
I replied, for an uneasy remembrance shot across me of that symmetrical bundle of papers at home
I inquired, with some little indignation
said I, pressing him, for I thought I saw him near a loophole here
said the old man, after securing the drawbridge
said the old man, in his chirping way, while he warmed his hands at the blaze
he appeared to mean up the chimney, but I believe he intended to refer me to Liverpool
pursued the old man, again laughing heartily
replied Wemmick, shaking his head
she said one evening, coming to such a check, when we sat apart at a darkening window of the house in Richmond
said Miss Havisham, flashing her eyes upon her
cried Miss Havisham, passionately striking her stick upon the floor
said Estella, preserving her attitude of indifference as she leaned against the great chimney-piece and only moving her eyes
retorted Estella, never departing from the easy grace of her attitude, never raising her voice as the other did, never yielding either to anger or tenderness
she touched her bosom with her hand
said Estella, raising her eyes after a silence
said Estella, in a musing way, after another moment of calm wonder
said Drummle, putting me out of the question
replied Estella, with a glance towards him
said she, laughing, after a moment
said Estella, casting her glance over the room
said Estella, turning suddenly with a fixed and serious, if not angry, look
he said, in a coarse broken voice
said he, looking over his shoulder
he returned, shaking his head at me with a deliberate affection, at once most unintelligible and most exasperating
he observed, when we had confronted one another in silence
he answered, still with the end at his mouth and still observant of me
said I, hurriedly putting something into a glass for myself, and drawing a chair to the table
he said then, with a smile that was like a frown, and with a frown that was like a smile
he went on, taking my watch out of my pocket, and turning towards him a ring on my finger, while I recoiled from his touch as if he had been a snake
turning his eyes round the room
said he, after again drawing his sleeve over his eyes and forehead, as the click came in his throat which I well remembered - and he was all the more horrible to me that he was so much in earnest
said I, rising from the sofa
said I, answering almost mechanically, in spite of my utmost efforts
he said, dropping his voice, and laying a long finger on my breast in an impressive manner
said the watchman, as he gave me back my glass
said I, speaking low as he took his seat at the table
he answered, in the same tone
he said, as a polite kind of apology when he made an end of his meal
said he, dandling my hands up and down in his, as he puffed at his pipe
he wound up, looking round the room and snapping his fingers once with a loud snap
said I, almost in a frenzy of fear and dislike
said he, laying his hand on my arm in a suddenly altered and subdued manner
he said, in the same tone as before
said he, putting his pipe back in his mouth
said he, pulling a greasy little clasped black Testament out of his pocket
returned Mr. Jaggers, turning his eyes upon me coolly, and taking a bite at his forefinger
said Mr. Jaggers, looking hard at me
pursued Mr. Jaggers, still looking hard at me
said Mr. Jaggers, offering his hand
said I, shutting the double doors, while Herbert stood staring and wondering
he said to Herbert, after having discoursed for some time
said I to Herbert, when he was safe in another chair
he replied, holding his head
said I, poker in hand
said he, superciliously over his shoulder
replied Miss Havisham, steadily nodding her head
said Miss Havisham, taking me up in a firm tone
she returned, again nodding, steadily
cried Miss Havisham, striking her stick upon the floor and flashing into wrath so suddenly that Estella glanced up at her in surprise
I said, to soothe her
I said, in answer, conscious that I reddened a little
said I, turning to her now, and trying to command my trembling voice
said I, in answer to that action
she said again, in a gentler voice
said Wemmick to the little servant
I said to Wemmick when he came back
which he emphasized and repeated for my guidance
said he, with his hands still in the sleeves
his hands were now out of his sleeves, and I was shaking them
said Herbert, when I told him so
said Herbert, showing me the basket, with a compassionate and tender smile after we had talked a little
said Herbert, as it was succeeded by silence
said Herbert, as the growl resounded in the beam once more
he answered, with a grave nod
he answered, clasping my hands
said Mr. Wopsle, drifting into his lost look again
said Mr. Wopsle, going on in the same lost way
I returned, glad for once to get the better of him in cross-examination
said Mr. Jaggers, handing it on
said I, glancing at Wemmick, who was putting fish into the post-office
said Wemmick to Mr. Jaggers
I interrupted, with a burning face and heart
said Mr. Jaggers, taking a decanter of choicer wine from his dumb-waiter, and filling for each of us and for himself
pursued Wemmick, with a look full of meaning
said Wemmick, touching me on the sleeve
she asked then, with her former air of being afraid of me
I said, when her cry had died away
I could not help saying
I answered, as delicately as I could
said I, after a short silence, in a hurried way
said he, as I put the cheque in my pocket, when he had signed it
said Wemmick, rather reproachfully towards me
asked Mr. Jaggers, very coolly, as he paused with his handkerchief half way to his nose
said Mr. Jaggers at last, as he moved towards the papers on the table
said Mr. Jaggers, laying his hand upon my arm, and smiling openly
said the latter then, resuming his usual manner
said a suppressed voice with an oath
said the suppressed voice with another oath
said he, when we had surveyed one another for some time
said he, bringing his fist down upon the table with a heavy blow, and rising as the blow fell, to give it greater force
said he, folding his arms on the table again
said he, folding his arms again
he cried, laughing, after doing it again
said Trabb's boy, in a sober voice
he returned, drawing a long breath
said the Jack, repeating the obnoxious word with the greatest contempt
said Wemmick, scratching his head
said Wemmick, triumphantly shouldering the fishing-rod as we came out
returned one of them, bending down and touching me on the shoulder
said Joe, summing up with his judicial air
Joe added, after a little grave reflection
said Joe, in a tone of remonstrance, and by way of getting at it by degrees
said Joe, repeating the legal turn as if it did him infinite good
by which I presently understood he meant Camilla
he would often say, in explanation of that liberty
I asked him that evening, upon further consideration, as he smoked his pipe at the window
said Joe, after meditating a long time, and looking rather evasively at the window-seat
said Joe, as if I had answered
said Joe, in his favourite argumentative way
said Joe, quite charmed with his logical arrangement
said Joe, appearing a little hurried and troubled
said Mr. Pumblechook to the waiter
said I, firing in spite of myself
said he, releasing the handle of the article in question, retiring a step or two from my table, and speaking for the behoof of the landlord and waiter at the door
said Pumblechook, turning to the landlord and waiter, and pointing me out at arm's length
said Pumblechook, screwing his head at me in the old fashion
said Pumblechook, and all this with a most exasperating air of saying in the cause of virtue what was perfectly convincing and conclusive
here Pumblechook shook his head and hand at me
said I, scornfully, as I finished my interrupted breakfast
cried Biddy, in a burst of happiness
said Joe, from behind his sleeve
said Joe, delighted when I took another stool by the child's side (but I did not rumple his hair
said I, when I talked with her after dinner, as her little girl lay sleeping in her lap
she said, in a voice of touching interest to a wanderer
