Master Lionel, dear,
they've come to fetch you to go and be King
Oh, don't, Nurse
I'm sure
my ears are quite clean
Never mind my hair, it's all right
That'll do
You're going on as if you was going to be an eel instead of a King
Sire, your
great-great-great-great-great-grandfather, the King of this country, is
dead, and now you have got to come and be King
Yes, please, sir
when does it begin
You will be crowned this afternoon
Would you like me to bring Nurse, or what time would you like me to be
fetched, and hadn't I better put on my velvet suit with the lace
collar
Your Nurse will be removed to the Palace later. No, never mind about
changing your suit; the Royal robes will cover all that up
Thank you for washing me. I wish I'd let you do the other ear.
No -- there's no time now. Give me the hanky. Good-bye, Nurse
Good-bye, ducky
Be a good little King now, and say
'please' and 'thank you,' and remember to pass the cake to the little
girls, and don't have more than two helps of anything
Long live Lionel! Long
live our little King
I thought we were a Republic
I'm sure there hasn't been
a King for some time
Sire, your great-great-great-great-great-grandfather's death happened
when my grandfather was a little boy
and
since then your loyal people have been saving up to buy you a crown -- so
much a week, you know, according to people's means -- sixpence a week from
those who have first-rate pocket money, down to a halfpenny a week from
those who haven't so much. You know it's the rule that the crown must be
paid for by the people
But hadn't my great-great-however-much-it-is-grandfather a crown
Yes, but he sent it to be tinned over, for fear of vanity, and he had
had all the jewels taken out, and sold them to buy books. He was a
strange man; a very good King he was, but he had his faults -- he was fond
of books. Almost with his last breath he sent the crown to be
tinned -- and he never lived to pay the tinsmith's bill
I think I should like a book. Will you get me
one, Nurse
Bless the child
You don't suppose you've lost the use of
your legs with just being a King? Run along, do, and get your books
yourself
Oh, what a worldful of books!
Are they yours
They are yours, Your Majesty
They were the
property of the late King, your great-great
Yes, I know
Well, I shall read them all. I love
to read. I am so glad I learned to read
If I might venture to advise Your Majesty
I
should not read these books. Your great
Yes
He was a very good King -- oh, yes, really a very superior King in his
way, but he was a little -- well, strange
Mad
No, no
Not mad; but if I
may express it so, he was -- er -- too clever by half. And I should not like
a little King of mine to have anything to do with his books
The fact is
your great
Go on
was called a wizard
But he wasn't
Of course not -- a most worthy King was your great
I see
But I wouldn't touch his books
Just this one
I must look at this one
Don't be a silly little King
There
Isn't that lovely? Why
Well
that's
magic, that is
Blue Bird of Paradise
You're a naughty, disobedient little King
I don't see that I've done any harm
No harm
Ah -- but what do you know about it?
That's the question. How do you know what might have been on the next
page -- a snake or a worm, or a centipede or a revolutionist, or
something like that
Well, I'm sorry if I've vexed you
Come, let's kiss and
be friends
Dragon
The dragon flew away across the garden
You naughty little King! Put him to bed,
Nurse, and let him think over what he's done
Perhaps, my Lord
we'd better first find out
just exactly what he has done
It's a Red Dragon, and it's gone
flying away to the hills, and I am so sorry, and, oh, do forgive me
You are a naughty little King
and nobody will love you
There is to be a law
forbidding people to open books in schools or elsewhere
People will love me now I've made such a lot of pretty new laws for
them
Don't count your chickens, my dear. You haven't seen
the last of that Dragon yet
We might as well
be a Republic. After saving up all these years to get his crown, and
everything
After all
soccer is a dangerous game, and perhaps it is
wise to discourage it
Suppose I could get another beast out who would
fight the Dragon
cora
What animal ends in
'cora
The Manticora, of course
What is he like
He is the sworn foe of Dragons
He drinks their
blood. He is yellow, with the body of a lion and the face of a man. I
wish we had a few Manticoras here now. But the last died hundreds of
years ago -- worse luck
Manticora
Go along and fight the Dragon,
do
The Manticora took refuge in the General Post Office
Nurse, wipe my
face, please. I am not going to cry any more
Crying
never did anyone any good yet
I don't know
I seem to see better, and to hear
better now that I've cried for a week. Now, Nurse, dear, I know I'm
right, so kiss me in case I never come back. I _must_ try to see if I
can't save the people
Well, if you must, you must
but don't tear your clothes
or get your feet wet
Hippogriff
But for the wings
you are very like my poor, dear lost Rocking Horse
Fly, dear Hippogriff, fly your very fastest to the
Pebbly Waste
Oh, hurrah
Now we really have done it
Oh, my precious Hippogriff
You are the bravest, dearest,
most beautiful
Hush
Don't you see that we are
not alone
I do not care for public life
I should like
to live
somewhere where Dragons can't get at me
What will you do when you grow up, Princess
I should like to marry you, Tom
Would you mind
No
I shouldn't mind much. I'll marry you if
you like -- if I have time
Now, my dears, what would you like to do this afternoon
Oh, do let's go to the Zoological Gardens and ride on the big guinea
pig and feed the rabbits and hear the dormouse asleep
Hurry up
Come down and lie still, can't you
Dear Tom, dear
good, clever Tom, you deserve all the prizes. And I will give you my pet
elephant -- and you can keep him till we're married
Oh dear, oh dear, I wish he wouldn't, I am so sleepy
I wonder whatever is the matter. As soon as
it's light I'll go and see
I'll go to the pillar
I am afraid you don't feel quite well
Can I get you anything
A bun or two, now
There's a beautiful bun tree
quite close
Here, try to eat a little.
You'll soon feel better then
Perhaps it's all for the best
I might not have liked that
prize either, if I had gotten it
Let's go and see the dragon
Don't be silly,
because it's only in fairy stories and histories of England and things
like that, that people are unkind and want to hurt each other. In
Rotundia everyone is kind, and no one has anything to be afraid of,
unless they're naughty; and then we know it's for our own good. Let's
all go and see the dragon. We might take him some acid drops
Oh, you nice,
kind, pretty little Princess
Oh, you nice, fat, pretty little Princess, I should like
to eat you instead of these silly acid drops
What is it, Fido -- good little elephant -- then
Oh, something is to happen on her birthday? All right. I'll be on the
lookout
By-and-by he began to wander
There he goes
Friends -- fellow citizens -- I cannot disguise from
myself or from you that this purple dragon is a poor penniless exile, a
helpless alien in our midst, and, besides, he is a -- is no end of a
dragon
Hear, hear
Something has happened to a gentle and defenseless
member of our community. We don't know what has happened
The defenses of our country have been swallowed up
There is only one thing to be done
Could we ever forgive ourselves if by neglecting a simple
precaution we lost more rabbits -- or even, perhaps, our navy, our police,
and our fire brigade? For I warn you that the purple dragon will respect
nothing, however sacred
What is the simple
precaution
Tomorrow is the dragon's birthday. He is
accustomed to have a present on his birthday. If he gets a nice present
he will be in a hurry to take it away and show it to his friends, and he
will fly off and never come back
The present the dragon expects
is
rather an expensive one. But, when we give, it should not be in a
grudging spirit, especially to visitors. What the dragon wants is a
Princess. We have only one Princess, it is true; but far be it from us
to display a miserly temper at such a moment. And the gift is worthless
that costs the giver nothing. Your readiness to give up your Princess
will only show how generous you are
Come up and kiss me
Many happy returns of the day
Oh, Tom -- how can you? When you
know quite well
Oh, don't
Why, Mary Ann, my precious, my Princess -- what do
you think I should be doing while the dragon was getting his birthday
present? Don't cry, my own little Mary Ann! Fido and I have arranged
everything. You've only got to do as you are told
Is that all
Oh -- that's easy -- I've often done
that
Oh, you dear, good, clever Tom
How glad I am that I
gave you Fido. You two have saved me. You dears
Come, little birthday present
The dragon will be
so pleased. And I'm glad to see you're not crying. You know, my child,
we cannot begin too young to learn to think of the happiness of others
rather than our own. I should not like my dear little niece to be
selfish, or to wish to deny a trivial pleasure to a poor, sick dragon,
far from his home and friends
Good morning, sir. We have brought you a small
present for your birthday. We do not like to let such an anniversary go
by without some suitable testimonial, especially to one who is a
stranger in our midst. Our means are small, but our hearts are large. We
have but one Princess, but we give her freely -- do we not, my child
Run
Just to see
fair
What do you mean, sir
by
intruding on a State function with your common rabbits and things? Go
away, naughty little boy, and play with them somewhere else
State Function
Fair play -- play fair! We can't go back on our word
like this. Give a thing and take a thing? Why, it's never done. Let the
poor exiled stranger dragon have his birthday present
Yes
Fair play is a jewel. And your helpless exile shall
have the Princess -- if he can catch her. Now then, Mary Ann
Bo! you
can't catch me
Yah -- who's won now
The dragon ran after her
Funny little thing
I will take
it for a birthday present
the happy
pair
This is very curious
I don't
believe it's out
Oh, yes -- it's out
Here it is, on the brush. This is
very interesting
What
Dear me
Dear, dear me! Four well-developed limbs; a long
caudal appendage; five toes, unequal in lengths, almost like one of the
_Lacertidae_, yet there are traces of wings
Yes; a batlike
wing. A new specimen, undoubtedly. Effie, run round to the professor and
ask him to be kind enough to step in for a few minutes
You might give me sixpence, Daddy
because I did bring
you the new specimen. I took great care of it inside my eye, and my eye
_does_ hurt
Why, it's a tiny newt
I'll
give you half a crown for it, Harry, my lad
It is a new specimen
and finer than yours, Doctor
Why
I know what it is. It is a dragon like the one St.
George killed
The largest elephant in the zoo was carried off
Good
night, my darlings, sleep sound all day, and don't get up too soon. You
must not get up before it's quite dark. You wouldn't like the nasty
dragons to catch you
Don't get up till it is quite dark
Go now
It would not be disobedient to go. And I know
exactly what we ought to do, but I don't know how we ought to do it
What ought we to do
We ought to wake St. George, of course
He was the only
person in his town who knew how to manage dragons; the people in the
fairy tales don't count. But St. George is a real person, and he is only
asleep, and he is waiting to be waked up. Only nobody believes in St.
George now. I heard father say so
We do
Of course we do. And don't you see, Ef, that's the very reason why we
could wake him? You can't wake people if you don't believe in them, can
you
We must go and look
You shall wear a dragonproof
frock, made of stuff like the curtains. And I will smear myself all over
with the best dragon poison, and
Oh, Harry! I
know where we can find St. George! In St. George's Church, of course
Um
you have a
little sense sometimes, for a girl
Oh, I want to go home
Don't be silly
Surely you haven't forgotten about the
Seven Champions and all the princes. People who are going to be their
country's deliverers never scream and say they want to go home
And are we
deliverers, I mean
You'll see
How ever can we wake him
Oh, dear, good,
kind St. George, please wake up and help us
What's the matter, little girl
It's no good
they would be one too many for poor old
George. You should have waked me before. I was always for a fair
fight -- one man one dragon, was my motto
I can't do anything
Things have changed since my time. St.
Andrew told me about it. They woke him up over the engineers' strike,
and he came to talk to me. He says everything is done by machinery now;
there must be some way of settling these dragons. By the way, what sort
of weather have you been having lately
It has been very fine. Father says it is the
hottest weather there has ever been in this country
Ah, I guessed as much
Well, the
only thing would be ... dragons can't stand wet and cold, that's the
only thing. If you could find the taps
Good night, very sorry I can't help you
Oh, but you can
Tell us -- what taps
Oh, like in the bathroom
And
there's a looking glass, too; shows you all the world and what's going
on. St. Denis told me about it; said it was a very pretty thing. I'm
sorry I can't -- good night
We shall never find the taps
I say, wouldn't it be awful
if St. George woke up when there was a dragon near, the size that eats
champions
We didn't meet any the size of
the dining room as we came along
I daresay we shall be
quite safe
We might hide in the church till it is dark
and then
Oh, Harry
I wonder when he will eat us
He rose into the air, rattling like a third-class
carriage
He knows where he wants to go
Oh, if he would only drop
us before he gets there
We can't be worse off than we are
with a dragon waiting
for us outside. Let's go in
Sunshine
Wind
Rain
Snow
Hail
Ice
Fair to moderate
Showery
South
breeze
Nice growing weather for the crops
Skating
Good open
weather
South wind
East wind
Dragons do not like cold
They will put up a monument to us
as high as Nelson's!
All the dragons are dead
I hope the one that was waiting outside for us is dead
And about the monument, Harry, I'm not so sure. What can they do with
such a lot of dead dragons? It would take years and years to bury them,
and they could never be burnt now they are so soaking wet. I wish the
rain would wash them off into the sea
I wonder what this old thing's for
Waste
Let's turn it on
It might carry off the dragons
Oh, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah
Showery
Good open
weather
Nice growing weather for the crops
South-West
Waste
Sunshine
Oh, my darlings, my darlings, you're safe -- you're safe!
You naughty children -- how could you be so disobedient? Go to bed at
once
I wish I had known what you were
going to do! I should have liked to preserve a specimen. I threw away
the one I got out of Effie's eye. I intended to get a more perfect
specimen. I did not anticipate this immediate extinction of the
species
Long Live our Royal Darling
Oh, how pretty
I wonder what they are. It looks as if the
fairies were planting little shining baby poplar trees and watering them
with liquid light
Liquid fiddlestick
But what is the Rory Bory what's-its-name
Who lights it,
and what's it there for
But I know
that it has something to do with the Great Bear,
and the Dipper, and the Plough, and Charles's Wain
And what are they
Oh, they're the surnames of some of the star families. There goes a
jolly rocket
I wish we could see them nearer
I wonder if the star
families are nice families -- the kind that Mother would like us to go to
tea with, if we were little stars
They aren't that sort of families at all, Silly
I only said 'families' because a kid like you
wouldn't have understood if I'd said constel ... and, besides, I've
forgotten the end of the word. Anyway, the stars are all up in the sky,
so you can't go to tea with them
No
I said if we were little stars
But we aren't
No
I know that. I'm not so stupid as you
think, George. But the Tory Bories are somewhere at the edge. Couldn't
we go and see them
Considering you're eight, you haven't much sense
It's half the world away
It looks very near
They're close to the North Pole
Look here -- I don't care
a straw about the Aurora Borealis, but I shouldn't mind discovering the
North Pole: It's awfully difficult and dangerous, and then you come home
and write a book about it with a lot of pictures, and everybody says how
brave you are
Oh, George, _let's_
We shall never have such a chance
again -- all alone by ourselves -- and quite late, too
I'd go right enough if it wasn't for you
but you know they always say I lead you into mischief -- and if we went
to the North Pole we should get our boots wet, as likely as not, and
you remember what they said about not going on the grass
They said the _lawn_
We're not going on the _lawn_. Oh,
George, do, do let's. It doesn't look so _very_ far -- we could be back
before they had time to get dreadfully angry
All right
but mind, I don't want to go
It's like Indians
Polar bears and Arctic wolves, of course I mean
Way or no way, I know a slide when I see one -- so here
goes
I can see the Northern Lights quite plain
Hey! You there! Stop
Tumble for your life
You don't happen to have any bullets about you
No
I had five of father's revolver
cartridges, but they were taken away the day Nurse turned out my pockets
to see if I had taken the knob of the bathroom door by mistake
Quite so
these accidents will occur. You don't
carry firearms, then, I presume
I haven't any fire_arms_
but I have a fire_work_. It's
only a squib one of the boys gave me, if that's any good
One could but try
Ask him
what he wants it for
No, I shan't.
The reason for shooting him stopped yesterday -- I heard Father say so -- so
it wouldn't be fair, anyhow. I'm very sorry; but I can't -- so there
Hey! You there! Stop
Tumble for your life
Excuse me
but have you such a thing as a needle
about you -- a very long needle
I have a needle _book_
but there aren't any
needles in it now. George took them all to do the things with pieces of
cork -- in the 'Boy's Own Scientific Experimenter' and 'The Young
Mechanic.' He did not do the things, but he did for the needles
Curiously enough
I too wish to use the needle in
connection with cork
I have a hatpin in my hood
I fastened the fur with it
when it caught in the nail on the greenhouse door. It is very long and
sharp -- would that do
One could but try
Ask what he wants it
for
a magnificent specimen
which I am most anxious to preserve
Oh, I couldn't
Well, well
here's a whole Arctic expedition thrown away! I
shall have to go home and fit out another. And that means a lot of
writing to the papers and things. You seem to be a singularly
thoughtless little girl
It is like a dream
It _is_ the North Pole. Just think of the fuss people
always make about getting here -- and it was no trouble at all, really
I daresay lots of people have gotten here
It's
not the getting _here_ -- I see that -- it's the getting back again.
Perhaps no one will ever know that _we_ have been here, and the robins
will cover us with leaves and
Nonsense
There aren't any robins, and there aren't any
leaves. It's just the North Pole, that's all, and I've found it; and now
I shall try to climb up and plant the British flag on the top -- my
handkerchief will do; and if it really _is_ the North Pole, my pocket
compass Uncle James gave me will spin around and around, and then I
shall know. Come on
It is a very curious shape
It's almost like
it's almost like a dragon
It's much more like the lampposts on the Thames Embankment
Oh, George
it _is_ a dragon; I can see its wings.
Whatever shall we do
Oh, don't bother; I'm thinking how to
get onto the Pole and try the compass without waking the brute
Sure enough, it was a dragon
It's bears
I know it is. Oh, how I wish we hadn't come;
and my boots are so wet
Bears, indeed
You'll wish we were bears before
you've done with us
Don't cry for real
or you'll get chilblains in
your eyes. But pretend to howl -- it frightens them
Yah -- who's afraid? We are George and Jane -- who are you
We are the sealskin dwarfs
We are very precious and expensive, for we are made,
throughout, of the very best sealskin
And what are those fires for
Those
are the fires we
make to thaw the dragon. He is frozen now -- so he sleeps curled up around
the Pole -- but when we have thawed him with our fires he will wake up and
go and eat everybody in the world except us
WHATEVER -- DO -- YOU -- WANT -- HIM -- TO -- DO -- THAT -- FOR
Oh -- just for spite
Just for fun
You are heartless
No, we aren't
Our hearts are made of the finest sealskin,
just like little fat sealskin purses
Thank you so much for telling us
Good evening. (Keep on
howling, Jane
What's that on your
head
It's made of one of us
or else one of the seals, our poor relations. Boy, now your
fate is sealed
Now the dragon will get warm, and when he gets warm he
will wake, and when he wakes he will be hungry, and when he is hungry he
will begin to eat, and the first thing he will eat will be you
We shan't be very nice when the dragon does eat us, that's one
comfort
We shall be turned into ice long before that
Can I be of any assistance
The dwarfs seized the children
One moment. I am only too
grateful for this opportunity of showing my sense of your manly conduct
about the firework
Oh, you dear, good, kind white grouse
but you'll be cold
yourself, won't you, now you have given us all your pretty dear
feathers
Did you think all those feathers came out of one breast? There are
hundreds and hundreds of us here, and every one of us can spare a little
tuft of soft breast feathers to help to keep two kind little hearts
warm
You've got a warm nest, and we'll see that no one takes it from you.
What more can you possibly want
Oh, _do_
mind your wings in the fires
What's the matter
Sealskin, are they
Just you wait a minute
I fear the moths have got at
my ermine tippet
Your poor Aunt Emma had a lovely sable cloak,
but it was eaten by moths
Oh, thank you -- thank you, darling Arctic moth
You are
good -- I do hope you haven't eaten enough to disagree with you
afterward
We should be a poor set of fellows if we couldn't over eat ourselves
once in a while -- to oblige a friend
Oh, dear
this is the worst of all
We've no friends left to help us
This is something like! How faint those
fires did make me feel
He's going to take us home
Oh, he is a good dragon. I
_am_ glad
What do you want, my dear
Oh, if you please
I want a baby -- a very nice one. We
don't want any expense spared. My husband said
Oh, yes
I know all about him. And so you want a
child? Do you know it will bring you sorrow
It will bring me joy first
Great sorrow
Greater joy
Well, have your own way. I suppose it's as much as
your place is worth to go back without it
The King would be very much annoyed
Well, well
What will you give me for the child
Anything you ask for, and all I have
Then give me your gold crown
And your necklace of blue sapphires
And your pearl bracelets
And your ruby clasps
Now the lilies from your breast
And the diamonds of your little bright shoe buckles
Your child will have hair as golden as your
crown, eyes as blue as your sapphires. The red of your rubies will lie
on its lips, and its skin will be clear and pale as your pearls. Its
soul will be white and sweet as your lilies, and your diamonds will be
no clearer than its wits
Oh, thank you, thank you
and when will it come
You will find it when you get home
And won't you have something for yourself
Any
little thing you fancy -- would you like a country, or a sack of jewels
Nothing, thank you
I could make more diamonds in a
day than I should wear in a year
Well, but do let me do some little thing for you
Aren't you tired of being a witch? Wouldn't you like to be a Duchess or
a Princess, or something like that
There is one thing I should rather like
but it's
hard to get in my trade
Oh, tell me what
I should like some one to love me
Why
I love you better than my life!
You've given me the baby -- and the baby shall love you too
Perhaps it will
and when the sorrow comes, send for
me. Each of your fifty kisses will be a spell to bring me to you. Now,
drink up your medicine, there's a dear, and run along home
Oh, you silly, silly Queen
Why didn't I marry a clever
lady? Did you think I went to all the trouble and expense of sending you
to a witch to get a girl? You knew well enough it was a boy I wanted -- a
boy, an heir, a Prince -- to learn all my magic and my enchantments, and
to rule the kingdom after me. I'll bet a crown -- my crown
you
never even thought to tell the witch what kind you wanted! Did you now
Very well, madam
very well -- have your own way. And
make the most of your daughter, while she is a child
A girl indeed
I wonder you can dare to look
me in the face, when you remember how your silliness has spoiled
everything
You oughtn't to speak to my mother like that
My dear child, don't interfere
My dear, why do you go on worrying about
it? Our daughter is not a boy, it is true -- but she may marry a clever
man who could rule your kingdom after you, and learn as much magic as
ever you cared to teach him
If she does marry
her husband will have to be a
very clever man -- oh, yes, very clever indeed! And he will have to know a
very great deal more magic than I shall ever care to teach him
Ah
don't punish the child because she loves her mother
I'm not going to punish her for that
I'm only going to
teach her to respect her father
Here
you shall stay, my dear, respectful daughter, till the clever man comes
to marry you. He'll have to be clever enough to sail a ship through the
Nine Whirlpools that spin around the island, and to kill the dragon and
the griffin. Till he comes you'll never get any older or any wiser. No
doubt he will soon come. You can employ yourself in embroidering your
wedding gown. I wish you joy, my dutiful child
For the sake of the twice twenty-five kisses you gave me
I will help you. But it is the last thing I can do, and it is
not much. Your daughter is under a spell, and I can take you to her.
But, if I do, you will have to be turned to stone, and to stay so till
the spell is taken off the child
I would be a stone for a thousand years
if at
the end of them I could see my dear again
Oh, Mother, Mother, Mother
Now
I can do one or two other little things for you. Time shall not
make the Princess sad. All days will be like one day till her deliverer
comes. And you and I, dear Queen, will sit in stone at the gate of the
tower. In doing this for you I lose all my witch's powers, and when I
say the spell that changes you to stone, I shall change with you, and if
ever we come out of the stone, I shall be a witch no more, but only a
happy old woman
Bout ship
What light
is that
All good things defend you, Nigel, from sailing
near that light. It is not mentioned in all charts; but it is marked
in the old chart I steer by, which was my father's father's before me,
and his father's father's before him. It is the light that shines from
the Lone Tower that stands above the Nine Whirlpools. And when my
father's father was young he heard from the very old man, his
great-great-grandfather, that in that tower an enchanted Princess,
fairer than the day, waits to be delivered. But there is no deliverance,
so never steer that way; and think no more of the Princess, for that is
only an idle tale. But the whirlpools are quite real
The Lone Tower on the Island of the Nine Whirlpools
I've come to save you
How darling and beautiful you are
You are very good, and very clever, and very dear
So now, when the tide is low again, I will take you away in my boat
But what about the dragon and the griffin
Dear me
I didn't know about them. I suppose I can kill
them
Don't be a silly boy
You
haven't a sword, or a shield, or anything
Well, don't the beasts ever go to sleep
Why, yes
but only once in twenty-four hours, and
then the dragon is turned to stone. But the griffin has dreams. The
griffin sleeps at teatime every day, but the dragon sleeps every day for
five minutes, and every day it is three minutes later than it was the
day before
What time does he sleep today
At eleven
Ah
can you do sums
No
I was never good at them
Then I must
I can, but it's slow work, and it makes me
very unhappy. It'll take me days and days
Don't begin yet
You'll have plenty of time to be
unhappy when I'm not with you. Tell me all about yourself
I know I've been here a long time
but I don't know what
Time is. And I am very busy sewing silk flowers on a golden gown for my
wedding day. And the griffin does the housework -- his wings are so
convenient and feathery for sweeping and dusting. And the dragon does
the cooking -- he's hot inside, so, of course, it's no trouble to him; and
though I don't know what Time is I'm sure it's time for my wedding day,
because my golden gown only wants one more white daisy on the sleeve,
and a lily on the bosom of it, and then it will be ready
It's the dragon
Good-bye. Be a good boy, and get your sum done
If the whirlpools stop and the tide goes down
once in every twenty-four hours, and they do it five minutes earlier
every twenty-four hours, and if the dragon sleeps every day, and he does
it three minutes later every day, in how many days and at what time in
the day will the tide go down three minutes before the dragon falls
asleep
Why, you've been seven hours over that sum
and you haven't
done it yet. Look here, this is what is written on the tablet of the
statue by the lower gate. It has figures in it. Perhaps it is the answer
to the sum
Dear Princess
I know that's the right answer. It says R
too, you see. But I'll just prove it
So now we must wait
You're sure he won't hurt you, my only treasure
Quite
I only wish I were half as sure that he
wouldn't hurt you
My Princess
two great powers are on our side: the
power of Love and the power of Arithmetic. Those two are stronger than
anything else in the world
Good-bye, love
Now, there's only the griffin
Yes -- only
You know a griffin is half a lion and half
an eagle, and the other two halves when they've joined make the
leo-griff. But I've never seen him. Yet I have an idea
Look out! There's a lion behind you
Poor griffin
it was very good at the housework. I
always liked it better than the dragon: It wasn't so hot-tempered
Well, but what about
the whirlpools
I'm not a witch
anymore. I'm only a happy old woman, but I know some things still. Those
whirlpools were made by the enchanter-King's dropping nine drops of his
blood into the sea. And his blood was so wicked that the sea has been
trying ever since to get rid of it, and that made the whirlpools. Now
you've only got to go out at low tide
Little children play around him and over him
I heard nothing
Neither did I
It can't be anything in the dungeon
Why, I shall have to go down there after more coals in a minute
There isn't anything there, of course. How could there be
I am not taking the hammer because I think there is something there
but it is handy for breaking the large lumps of coal
I quite understand
It must have come up those nasty broken steps from goodness knows
where
No you don't
Deary, deary me
Here's a nice end for a respectable blacksmith
Do you mind saying that again
_Here_ -- _is_ -- _a_ -- _nice_ -- _end_ -- _for_ -- _a_ -- _respectable_ -- _blacksmith
I didn't know
Fancy now! You're the very man I
wanted
So I understood you to say before
Oh, I don't mean what you mean
but I should like
you to do a job for me. One of my wings has got some of the rivets out
of it just above the joint. Could you put that to rights
I might, sir
A master craftsman -- you are a master, of course?-- can see in a minute
what's wrong
Just come around here and feel my
plates, will you
You could certainly do with a rivet or two, sir
In fact,
you want a good many
Well, get to work, then
You mend my wing, and then
I'll go out and eat up all the town, and if you make a really smart job
of it I'll eat you last. There
I don't want to be eaten last, sir
Well then, I'll eat you first
I don't want that, sir, either
Go on with you, you silly man
you don't know your
own silly mind. Come, set to work
I don't like the job, sir
and that's the truth. I know
how easily accidents happen. It's all fair and smooth, and 'Please rivet
me, and I'll eat you last'-- and then you get to work and you give a
gentleman a bit of a nip or a dig under his rivets -- and then it's fire
and smoke, and no apologies will meet the case
Upon my word of honor as a dragon
I know you wouldn't do it on purpose, sir
but any
gentleman will give a jump and a sniff if he's nipped, and one of your
sniffs would be enough for me. Now, if you'd just let me fasten you up
It would be so undignified
We always fasten a horse up
and he's the 'noble animal
It's all very well
but how do I know you'd untie me
again when you'd riveted me? Give me something in pledge. What do you
value most
My hammer
A blacksmith is nothing without a hammer
But you'd want that for riveting me. You must think of something else,
and at once, or I'll eat you first
Whatever's that
It's only the baby
What's that
Something you value
Well, yes, sir, rather
Then bring it here
and I'll take care of it till
you've done riveting me, and you shall tie me up
All right, sir
but I ought to warn you. Babies are poison
to dragons, so I don't deceive you. It's all right to touch -- but don't
you go putting it into your mouth. I shouldn't like to see any harm come
to a nice-looking gentleman like you
All right, I'll be
careful. Now go and fetch the thing, whatever it is
You just purr to it, sir
and it'll be as good as gold
Six, eight, ten -- twenty, forty
I haven't half enough rivets
in the shop. If you'll excuse me, sir, I'll step around to another forge
and get a few dozen. I won't be a minute
The dragon's purring pleased the baby
There's a dragon in my dungeon
I've chained him up. Now
come and help to get my baby away
But what about my baby
Oh, well
if anything should happen, you will always
be able to remember that your baby perished in a good cause
You've given the baby to the dragon
Oh, you unnatural
parent
Hush
Now
I'm going
down. After I've been down you can go, and if you keep your head the boy
will be all right
Hurry up, can't you
I can't keep up this noise all night
I'm very sorry, sir
but all the shops are shut.
The job must wait till the morning. And don't forget you've promised to
take care of that baby. You'll find it a little wearing, I'm afraid.
Good night, sir
Oh, dear
this is awful
And I am so tired too
I did so hope I should have a
good night
There'll be no peace for me after this
It's enough
to ruin one's nerves. Hush, then -- did 'ums, then
Hush-a-by, Dragon
I can't
keep it quiet
Here, I say
do you know anything
about babies
I do, a little
Then I wish you'd take this one, and let me get some sleep
You can bring it back in the morning before the
blacksmith comes
I've got the dragon and I've
saved the town
Noble preserver
we will get up a subscription for
you, and crown you in public with a laurel wreath
We're lost
I'd give a thousand pounds to anyone who
could keep that giant out of the town. I know what he eats -- by his
teeth
Who's there
It's only us
Come in, dears
You won't hurt us, or breathe fire at us or anything
Not for worlds
There's a lame giant in the town. He wants you
Does he
If only I were out of
this
If we let you loose you might manage to run away before he could catch
you
Yes, I might
but then again I mightn't
Why -- you'd never fight him
No
I'm all for peace, I am. You let me out, and
you'll see
The giant is settled. Please give us the
thousand pounds reward
No, no, my boy. It is not you who have settled the
giant, it is the dragon. I suppose you have chained him up again? When
he comes to claim the reward he shall have it
He isn't chained up yet
Shall I send him to claim the
reward
I don't trust you
Look how you treated my father when
he chained up the dragon
Done
Will you help us to
save the town
Yes, of course we will. What fun
Well, then
you must all bring your basins of bread and
milk to the forge tomorrow at breakfast time
And if ever I am mayor
I will give a banquet, and you
shall be invited. And we'll have nothing but sweet things from beginning
to end
What's that noise
It's only a big giant breathing
He's gone by now
May we come in
Oh, yes
it's very dull here
What's this
And what's the matter
This is bread and milk
it's our breakfast -- all of it
Well
I don't see what you want with breakfast. I'm
going to eat everyone in the town as soon as I've rested a little
Dear Mr. Dragon
I wish you wouldn't eat us. How would you
like to be eaten yourself
Not at all
but nobody will eat me
I don't know
there's a giant
I know. I fought with him, and licked him
Yes, but there's another come now -- the one you fought was only this
one's little boy. This one is half as big again
He's seven times as big
No, nine times
He's bigger than the steeple
Oh, dear
I never expected this
And the mayor has told him where you are
and he is
coming to eat you as soon as he has sharpened his big knife. The mayor
told him you were a wild dragon -- but he didn't mind. He said he only ate
wild dragons -- with bread sauce
That's tiresome
And I suppose this sloppy stuff in
the tub is the bread sauce
Of course
bread sauce is only
served with wild dragons. Tame ones are served with apple sauce and
onion stuffing. What a pity you're not a tame one: He'd never look at
you then
Good-bye, poor dragon, we shall never see you
again, and now you'll know what it's like to be eaten
Well, but look here
couldn't you pretend I was a
tame dragon? Tell the giant that I'm just a poor little timid tame
dragon that you kept for a pet
He'd never believe it
If you were our tame dragon we
should keep you tied up, you know. We shouldn't like to risk losing such
a dear, pretty pet
If giants like
this damp, white stuff, perhaps I should like it too
Excuse my troubling you, but could you
bring me a little more bread and milk
I don't know how I could ever have liked eating anything
but bread and milk. I _am_ a tame dragon now, aren't I
I am so tame, won't you undo
me
Excuse me a moment, there are one or two little things I
should like to fetch
It's no good to me
Perhaps you might find it useful
More where that came from
He brought something in his mouth -- it was a bag of
gold
Good morning, pretty world
Dear me, what a curious, shiny, bright-looking
creature! If it were bigger, and if I didn't know that there have been
no fabulous monsters for quite a long time now, I should almost think it
was a dragon
I wish it had not been in such a hurry to get back into the wood
Of course, it's quite safe for me, in my dragonproof tower;
but if it is a dragon, it's quite big enough to eat people, and today's
the first of May, and the children go out to get flowers in the wood
I do hope it wasn't a dragon
It's like a green silk mantle worked with flowers
All the embroidery is unpicked
The dragon, the dragon,
the dragon! Open the gates! The dragon is coming! The fiery dragon
Let them take care of themselves
My
business is to take care of you, my precious, and I'm going to do it.
Old as I am, I can turn a key still
Good sport
I wish the dragon would eat him
Tally ho! Hark forward!
Tantivy
The hunt is up
Who are you
I'm Elfin, the pig keeper
And who are you
I'm Tiresome, the Prince
And what are you doing out of your palace at this time of night
I've been hunting
Oh, it was you I saw, then? A good hunt, wasn't
it? My pigs and I were looking on
If you had known as much as I do
you might have saved
your pack
What do you mean
Why, the dragon
You went out at the wrong time of day.
The dragon should be hunted at night
No, thank you
A daylight hunt is
quite good enough for me, you silly pig keeper
Oh, well
do as you like about it -- the dragon will come
and hunt you tomorrow, as likely as not. I don't care if he does, you
silly Prince
You're very rude
Oh, no, only truthful
Well, tell me the truth, then. What is it that, if I had known as much
as you do about, I shouldn't have lost my hippopotamuses
You don't speak very good English
But come, what will
you give me if I tell you
If you tell me what
What you want to know
I don't want to know anything
Then you're more of a silly even than I thought
Don't
you want to know how to settle the dragon before he settles you
It might be as well
Well, I haven't much patience at any time
and now I can
assure you that there's very little left. What will you give me if I
tell you
Half my kingdom
and my cousin's hand in marriage
Done
Here goes! The dragon grows small at
night! He sleeps under the root of this tree. I use him to light my fire
with
How can I kill him
I don't know that you can kill him
but you can take him
away if you've brought anything to put him in. That bottle of yours
would do
Now we've got him
Let's take him home and put Solomon's
seal on the mouth of the bottle, and then he'll be safe enough. Come
along -- we'll divide up the kingdom tomorrow, and then I shall have some
money to buy fine clothes to go courting in
Go on with you! What do you mean
I found the dragon and
I've imprisoned him. I never said a word about courtings or kingdoms. If
you say I did, I shall cut your head off at once
All right
I'm better off than
you are, anyhow
What do you mean
Why, you've only got a kingdom (and a dragon), but I've got clean hands
(and five and seventy fine black pigs
You are
indeed brave and clever
Look at the bottle
The junior secretary cried out, 'Look at the bottle
You turn the key like this
and the door keeps shut. But
turn it nine times around the wrong way, and the door flies open
Oh, dear
do take care of me. I am so frightened
I will
Now you are quite
safe. What were you frightened of
The dragon
So it's gotten out of the silver bottle
I hope it's
eaten the Prince
No
But why
And he promised me half his kingdom and the hand of his cousin the
Princess
Oh, dear, what a shame
How dare he
What's the matter
It _was_ a shame,
or at least _I_ thought so. But now he may keep his kingdom, half and
whole, if I may keep what I have
What's that
Why, you -- my pretty, my dear
and as for the Princess,
his cousin -- forgive me, dearest heart, but when I asked for her I hadn't
seen the real Princess, the _only_ Princess, _my_ Princess
Do you mean me
Who else
Yes, but five minutes ago you hadn't seen me
Five minutes ago I was a pig keeper -- now I've held you in my arms I'm a
Prince, though I should have to keep pigs to the end of my days
But you haven't asked _me_
You asked me to take care of you
and I will -- all my life
long
The mistake
was in not having a dragonproof bottle. I
see that now
Oh, is that all
I can easily get you one of
those -- because everything in my tower is dragonproof. We ought to do
something to settle the dragon and save the little children
If what you say is true
if you are sure that I have a
heart of gold, the dragon won't hurt me, and somebody must stay with the
pigs
I thought you were never coming back
You have been away a
year, at least
Now then
you hold the bottle
Never mind
I'll put my finger in for a stopper
No, let me
The sea -- the sea -- run for the cliffs
We've saved the country
You've saved the little
children. Give me your hands
I can't
I shall never be able to take your dear hands
again. My hands are burnt off
He is the bravest man in the world
He has saved the
country and the little children; but, oh, his hands -- his poor, dear,
darling hands
See the dear creature
It knows,
it knows
The only cure for a dragon burn
is pig's fat,
and well that faithful creature knows it
I wouldn't for a kingdom
Is there no other cure
There is one other
The dear, affectionate
beasts -- they all want to die for you
What is the other cure
If a man is burnt by a dragon
and a certain number
of people are willing to die for him, it is enough if each should kiss
the burn and wish it well in the depths of his loving heart
The number! The number
Seventy-seven
We have only seventy-five pigs
and with me that's
seventy-six
It must be seventy-seven -- and I really can't die for him, so nothing
can be done
He must have cork hands
I knew about the seventy-seven loving people
But I never
thought my dear pigs loved me so much as all this, and my dear too -- and,
of course, that only makes it more impossible. There's one other charm
that cures dragon burns, though; but I'd rather be burnt black all over
than marry anyone but you, my dear, my pretty
Why, who must you marry to cure your dragon burns
A Princess. That's how St. George cured his burns
There now! Think of that
And I never heard tell of
that cure, old as I am
Then it's all right, my dear, brave, precious Elfin
for I
am a Princess, and you shall be my Prince. Come along, Nurse -- don't wait
to put on your bonnet. We'll go and be married this very moment
They saw a cloud of steam
It is such waste of time
They only know what everybody
knows. I want to find out new things that nobody has thought of but me
I don't think you're likely to find out anything that none of the wise
men in the whole world have thought of all these thousands of years
Self-Help
It seems to me
that the clucking is nearer
than the others
I _am_ going to find out something at last
My lantern's burning better and better
I expect it's the fire in the middle of the earth
Whatever are you
I'm a poor starving cockatrice
and I shall die -- oh, I know I shall! My fire's gone out! I
can't think how it happened; I must have been asleep. I have to stir it
seven times round with my tail once in a hundred years to keep it
alight, and my watch must have been wrong. And now I shall die
Cheer up
I'll light your fire for you
Cock-a-trice-a-doodle-doo
Don't mention it; delighted, I'm
sure
But what can I do for you
Tell me stories
What about
About true things that they don't know at school
But it's true
Just you look where the fire burnt my
hand
I see you've been playing with fire -- into mischief as usual
There's a great
dragon coming! Somebody ought to do something, or we shall all be
destroyed
But it's true
You just see if it isn't
It's only a thunder shower
Oh, my poor, dear granny
He'll jolly well have to believe it soon, anyhow
Well
What then
I don't think you quite understand
The dragon
has swallowed up the town
Does it matter
Creeping across the plain
But I live there
Never mind
You can live here with me
I'm afraid I haven't made my meaning clear
You see, my granny is in the town, and I can't bear to lose my granny
like this
I don't know what a granny may be
but if it's a possession to which you
attach any importance
Of course it is
Oh -- do help
me. What can I do
If I were you
I should find the
drakling and bring it here
But why
Oh, don't talk to me
I
give you advice; take it or leave it -- I shan't bother about you anymore.
If you bring the drakling here to me, I'll tell you what to do next. If
not, not
Hello, you drakling. Get out of bed this minute
It ain't time yet
Your mother says you are to, anyhow; and look sharp about it, what's
more
Hurry up
Mother said I was never to go out without my shoes
Come on then
Here it is
Your mother will be
here presently
I beg your pardon
but I am always accustomed to
having a little basin of fire as soon as I get up, and I feel rather
faint. Might I
Certainly not
Where were you brought
up? Did they never teach you that 'we must not ask for all we see'? Eh
I beg your pardon
but I am really _very_
hungry
If you are
really hungry, poor thing, I can show you where there is plenty of
fire
That smells good, eh
Yes
well, that's the fire in the middle of the earth.
There's plenty of it, all done to a turn. You'd better go down and begin
your breakfast, hadn't you
_Facilis descensus_
Now
Well, now
Go to the mouth of the cave and laugh
at the dragon so that she hears you
Why
She won't hear me
Oh, very well
No doubt you know best
What are you laughing at
That smells good, eh
At you
What are you laughing at
At you! You've eaten your own
drakling -- swallowed it with the town. Your own little drakling! He, he,
he! Ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha
Dear me
I _thought_ the town stuck in my throat
rather. I must take it out, and look through it more carefully
Why, whatever's the matter with Baby? He's not here
Well
where were you yesterday
But it _is_ true
Why, the whole town was swallowed by
the dragon. You know it was
Nonsense
There was a thunderstorm and an
earthquake, that's all
But
how do you account for the town being on the hillside
now, instead of by the river as it used to be
It was _always_ on the hillside
But look at the maps
A wild goose
is nothing like a cockatrice
