I hate gruel -- I hate barley water -- I hate bread and milk. I want to get
up and have something REAL to eat
What would you like
A pigeon-pie
a large pigeon-pie. A very large
one
Now, dear, if you're quite rested, and
quite comfy, we want to tell you about the great railway accident, and
ask your advice
All right
fire away
Hum
Is there NO hope
Hope? Rather! Tons of it
but it'll want
something besides hope -- a bit of brazing say, or some solder, and a new
valve. I think we'd better keep it for a rainy day. In other words, I'll
give up Saturday afternoon to it, and you shall all help me
CAN girls help to mend engines
Of course they can. Girls are just as clever as boys, and don't you
forget it! How would you like to be an engine-driver, Phil
My face would be always dirty, wouldn't it
and I expect I should break something
I should just love it
do you think I could when I'm
grown up, Daddy? Or even a stoker
You mean a fireman
Well, if you still wish it, when you're grown up, we'll see about
making you a fire-woman. I remember when I was a boy
Who on earth
An Englishman's house is his castle, of
course, but I do wish they built semi-detached villas with moats and
drawbridges
I've shown them into the Library, Sir
I expect it's the subscription to the Vicar's testimonial
or else it's the choir holiday fund. Get rid of them quickly,
dear. It does break up an evening so, and it's nearly the children's
bedtime
I wish we HAD got a moat and drawbridge
then, when we
didn't want people, we could just pull up the drawbridge and no one else
could get in. I expect Father will have forgotten about when he was a
boy if they stay much longer
They're going now
he's rung to have them shown out
Please'm
the Master wants you to just step into the study.
He looks like the dead, mum; I think he's had bad news. You'd best
prepare yourself for the worst, 'm -- p'raps it's a death in the family or
a bank busted or
That'll do, Ruth
you can go
It's bedtime
Ruth will put you to bed
But you promised we should sit up late tonight because Father's come
home
Father's been called away -- on business
Come, darlings,
go at once
It wasn't bad news, Mammy, was it? Is anyone dead -- or
Nobody's dead -- no
I can't tell you anything tonight, my pet. Go, dear, go NOW
I say, Ruth, what's up
Don't ask me no questions and I won't tell you no lies
You'll know soon enough
If Mother doesn't want us to know she's been crying
we WON'T know it. That's all
To London
There's something awful the matter
Ruth told me last night we should know soon enough
Did you ASK her
Yes, I did
If you could go to bed without
caring whether Mother was worried or not, I couldn't. So there
I don't think we ought to ask the servants things Mother doesn't tell
us
That's right, Miss Goody-goody
preach away
I'M not goody
but I think Bobbie's right this time
Of course. She always is. In her own opinion
Oh, DON'T
don't let's be
horrid to each other. I'm sure some dire calamity is happening. Don't
let's make it worse
Who began, I should like to know
I did, I suppose, but
Well, then
Now, my darlings, I want to tell you something. Those men last night
did bring very bad news, and Father will be away for some time. I am
very worried about it, and I want you all to help me, and not to make
things harder for me
As if we would
You can help me very much
by being good and happy
and not quarrelling when I'm away
for I shall have to be away a good deal
We won't quarrel. Indeed we won't
Then
I want you not to ask me any questions about
this trouble; and not to ask anybody else any questions
You'll promise this, too, won't you
I did ask Ruth
I'm very sorry, but I did
And what did she say
She said I should know soon enough
It isn't necessary for you to know anything about it
it's about business, and you never do understand business, do you
No
is it something to do with Government
Yes
Now it's bed-time, my darlings. And don't YOU
worry. It'll all come right in the end
Then don't YOU worry either, Mother
and we'll all be
as good as gold
We'll begin being good the first thing tomorrow morning
Why not NOW
There's nothing to be good ABOUT now, silly
We might begin to try to FEEL good
and not call
names
Who's calling names
Bobbie knows right enough that when
I say 'silly', it's just the same as if I said Bobbie
WELL
No, I don't mean what you mean. I mean it's just a -- what is it Father
calls it?-- a germ of endearment! Good night
I say
you used to say
it was so dull -- nothing happening, like in books. Now something HAS
happened
I never wanted things to happen to make Mother unhappy
Everything's perfectly horrid
You'll come to a bad end
you nasty little limb,
you! If you don't mend your ways, you'll go where your precious Father's
gone, so I tell you straight
Now, my pets, everything is settled. We're going to leave this house,
and go and live in the country. Such a ducky dear little white house. I
know you'll love it
Aren't you going to pack this, Mother
We can't take everything
But we seem to be taking all the ugly things
We're taking the useful ones
we've got to play at being
Poor for a bit, my chickabiddy
I say, this is larks
I do like moving! I wish we moved once a month
I don't
Good night, Peterkin
Oh, Mother
how
brave you are! How I love you! Fancy being brave enough to laugh when
you're feeling like THAT
But, oh, those poor little foreign children that she's going to
governess
I wouldn't be them for anything
Wake up, dears. We're there
Come
we've got to walk. There aren't any cabs here
There's the house
I wonder why she's shut the
shutters
Who's SHE
The woman I engaged to clean the place, and put the furniture straight
and get supper
That's the garden
It looks more like a dripping-pan full of black cabbages
You see your train was that late
But she's got the key
What are we to do
Oh, she'll have left that under the doorstep
folks do hereabouts
Ay, here it is, right enough
Got e'er a candle
I don't know where anything is
Oh, what's that
It's only the rats
Oh, dear
I wish we hadn't come
ONLY the rats
What fun
How frightened the poor mice were -- I don't believe they were
rats at all
Well
you've often wanted something to happen and now it
has. This is quite an adventure, isn't it? I told Mrs. Viney to get us
some bread and butter, and meat and things, and to have supper ready. I
suppose she's laid it in the dining-room. So let's go and see
Let's look in the other rooms
What a horrid old woman
she's just walked off with the
money and not got us anything to eat at all
Then shan't we have any supper at all
Oh, yes
only it'll mean unpacking one of those big
cases that we put in the cellar. Phil, do mind where you're walking to,
there's a dear. Peter, hold the light
Where's the hammer
That's just it
I'm afraid it's inside the box. But
there's a coal-shovel -- and there's the kitchen poker
Let me do it
You'll hurt your hands, Mammy
let me
I wish Father was here
he'd get it open in two shakes.
What are you kicking me for, Bobbie
I wasn't
Hooray
here are some candles -- the very first thing! You
girls go and light them. You'll find some saucers and things. Just drop
a little candle-grease in the saucer and stick the candle upright in
it
How many shall we light
As many as ever you like
The great thing is
to be cheerful. Nobody can be cheerful in the dark except owls and
dormice
It's very cold for May
Bravo
This is
something like! I'll just get a tablecloth and then
What a good thing Aunt Emma packed up all the odds and ends out of the
Store cupboard
Now, Phil, DON'T put the marmalade spoon
in among the sardines
No, I won't, Mother
Let's drink Aunt Emma's health
what should
we have done if she hadn't packed up these things? Here's to Aunt Emma
Good night, chickies
I'm sure there aren't any rats.
But I'll leave my door open, and then if a mouse comes, you need only
scream, and I'll come and tell it exactly what I think of it
Wassermarrer
Wake up! wake up
We're in the new house -- don't you
remember? No servants or anything. Let's get up and begin to be useful.
We'll just creep down mouse-quietly, and have everything beautiful
before Mother gets up. I've woke Peter. He'll be dressed as soon as we
are
It's much more fun than basin washing
How sparkly
the weeds are between the stones, and the moss on the roof -- oh, and the
flowers
This is far, far, far and away prettier than Edgecombe Villa
I wonder what the garden's like
We mustn't think of the garden yet
Let's go in and begin to work
We'll go into the garden now
Never mind the garden
let's go down and look at the
railway. There might be trains passing
We can see them from here
let's sit down a
bit
But it doesn't matter -- the cups and saucers, I mean
Because I've found another room -- I'd quite forgotten there was one. And
it's magic! And I've boiled the water for tea in a saucepan
Pie for breakfast
how perfectly ripping
It isn't pigeon-pie
it's only apple. Well, this is the
supper we ought to have had last night. And there was a note from Mrs.
Viney. Her son-in-law has broken his arm, and she had to get home early.
She's coming this morning at ten
You see it's more like dinner than breakfast to us
because we were up so early
There! That'll do for to-day. I'll lie down for an hour, so as to be as
fresh as a lark by supper-time
Oh, never mind about the garden now
Mother told me
this morning where it was. It'll keep till to-morrow. Let's get to the
railway
Oh
it was like a great dragon
tearing by. Did you feel it fan us with its hot wings
I suppose a dragon's lair might look very like that tunnel from the
outside
I never thought we should ever get as near to a train as this. It's the
most ripping sport
Better than toy-engines, isn't it
I don't know; it's different
It seems so odd to see ALL
of a train. It's awfully tall, isn't it
We've always seen them cut in half by platforms
I wonder if that train was going to London
London's
where Father is
Let's go down to the station and find out
ping, ping
Bible Stories for Infants
How do you
do
To mark how much coal there be
so as we'll know if
anyone nicks it. So don't you go off with none in your pockets, young
gentleman
quite poor now
Well, what is it
Mother
mayn't I light a fire? I do know how
No, my ducky-love. We mustn't have fires in June -- coal
is so dear. If you're cold, go and have a good romp in the attic.
That'll warm you
But, Mother, it only takes such a very little coal to make a fire
It's more than we can afford, chickeny-love
Now run away, there's darlings -- I'm madly busy
Mother's always busy now
Jam OR butter, dear -- not jam AND butter. We can't afford that sort of
reckless luxury nowadays
I have an idea
What's that
I shan't tell you
Oh, very well
Don't, then
Girls
are always so hasty tempered
I should like to know what boys are
I don't want to know about your silly ideas
You'll know some day
if you hadn't been so keen on a row, I
might have told you about it being only noble-heartedness that made me
not tell you my idea. But now I shan't tell you anything at all about
it -- so there
The only reason why I won't tell you my idea that I'm going to do is
because it MAY be wrong, and I don't want to drag you into it
Don't you do it if it's wrong, Peter
let me do it
_I_ should like to do wrong if YOU'RE going to
No
it's a forlorn hope,
and I'm going to lead it. All I ask is that if Mother asks where I am,
you won't blab
We haven't got anything TO blab
Oh, yes, you have
I've trusted you to the death. You know I'm going to do a lone
adventure -- and some people might think it wrong -- I don't. And if Mother
asks where I am, say I'm playing at mines
What sort of mines
You just say mines
You might tell US, Pete
Well, then, COAL-mines. But don't you let the word pass your lips on
pain of torture
You needn't threaten
and I do think you might let us
help
If I find a coal-mine, you shall help cart the coal
Keep your secret if you like
Keep it if you CAN
I'll keep it, right enough
Come hither with me
and bring the Roman Chariot
Follow your dauntless leader
Here's the first coal from the St. Peter's Mine. We'll take it home in
the chariot. Punctuality and despatch. All orders carefully attended to.
Any shaped lump cut to suit regular customers
I've been to my coal-mine
to-morrow evening we'll bring
home the black diamonds in the chariot
So I've caught you at last, have I, you young thief
I'm not a thief
I'm a
coal-miner
Tell that to the Marines
It would be just as true whoever I told it to
You're right there
Stow your jaw, you
young rip, and come along to the station
Oh, no
Not the POLICE station
Not yet
The Railway Station first. Why,
it's a regular gang. Any more of you
Only us
Wanted in No. 1 Road
What do you mean by spying on a fellow like this
Time someone did spy on you, _I_ think
Come
along to the station
Oh, DON'T
Can't you decide NOW what you'll do to us?
It's our fault just as much as Peter's. We helped to carry the coal
away -- and we knew where he got it
No, you didn't
Yes, we did
We knew all the time. We only pretended we
didn't just to humour you
Don't hold me
I won't run away
Why
you're the children from the Three Chimneys up yonder.
So nicely dressed, too. Tell me now, what made you do such a thing?
Haven't you ever been to church or learned your catechism or anything,
not to know it's wicked to steal
I didn't think it was stealing. I was almost sure it wasn't. I thought
if I took it from the outside part of the heap, perhaps it would be. But
in the middle I thought I could fairly count it only mining. It'll
take thousands of years for you to burn up all that coal and get to the
middle parts
Not quite. But did you do it for a lark or what
Not much lark carting that beastly heavy stuff up the hill
Then why did you
You know that wet day? Well, Mother said we were too poor to have a
fire. We always had fires when it was cold at our other house, and
DON'T
Well
I'll
tell you what I'll do. I'll look over it this once. But you remember,
young gentleman, stealing is stealing, and what's mine isn't yours,
whether you call it mining or whether you don't. Run along home
Do you mean you aren't going to do anything to us? Well, you are a
brick
You're a dear
You're a darling
That's all right
Don't speak to me
You're
spies and traitors -- that's what you are
We DID say it was us as much as you
Well -- and it wasn't
It would have come to the same thing in Courts with judges
Don't be snarky, Peter. It isn't our fault your secrets are so
jolly easy to find out
There's an awful lot of coal in the cellar, anyhow
Oh, don't
I don't think we ought to be glad about
THAT
I don't know
I'm not at all sure,
even now, that mining is a crime
The Green Dragon's going where Father is
if it were
a really real dragon, we could stop it and ask it to take our love to
Father
Dragons don't carry people's love
they'd be above it
Yes, they do, if you tame them thoroughly first. They fetch and carry
like pet spaniels
and feed out of your hand. I wonder
why Father never writes to us
Mother says he's been too busy
but he'll write soon,
she says
I say
let's all wave to the Green Dragon as it
goes by. If it's a magic dragon, it'll understand and take our loves to
Father. And if it isn't, three waves aren't much. We shall never miss
them
in business
Another story come home to roost. Oh, dear, Oh, dear
Hooray,
hooray. Here's a sensible Editor. He's taken my story and this is the
proof of it
Good morning
Perhaps he doesn't know who I am by daylight, or he wouldn't be so
polite
I don't want you to be polite to me if you don't know me when you see
me
Eh
I thought perhaps you didn't know it was me that took the coals
when you said 'Good morning.' But it was, and I'm sorry.
There
Why
I wasn't thinking anything at all about
the precious coals. Let bygones be bygones. And where were you off to in
such a hurry
I'm going to buy buns for tea
I thought you were all so poor
So we are
but we always have three
pennyworth of halfpennies for tea whenever Mother sells a story or a
poem or anything
Oh
so your Mother writes stories, does
she
The beautifulest you ever read
You ought to be very proud to have such a clever Mother
Yes
but she used to play with us more before she had to
be so clever
Well
I must be getting along. You give us
a look in at the Station whenever you feel so inclined. And as to coals,
it's a word that -- well -- oh, no, we never mention it, eh
Thank you
I'm very glad it's all straightened out
between us
But ought we
After the coals, she means
I met the Station Master yesterday
he expresspecially
invited us to go down any time we liked
After the coals
Stop a minute -- my bootlace is
undone again
It always IS undone again
and the Station Master was
more of a gentleman than you'll ever be, Phil -- throwing coal at a chap's
head like that
Why, what's the matter, darling
He called me un-un-ungentlemanly
I didn't never call
him unladylike, not even when he tied my Clorinda to the firewood bundle
and burned her at the stake for a martyr
Well, you began, you know
about coals and all
that. Don't you think you'd better both unsay everything since the wave,
and let honour be satisfied
I will if Peter will
All right
honour is satisfied. Here, use my hankie,
Phil, for goodness' sake, if you've lost yours as usual. I wonder what
you do with them
You had my last one
to tie up the
rabbit-hutch door with. But you're very ungrateful. It's quite right
what it says in the poetry book about sharper than a serpent it is to
have a toothless child -- but it means ungrateful when it says toothless.
Miss Lowe told me so
All right
I'm sorry. THERE! Now will you
come on
Why
If you could get a holt of one o' them when the train is going and pull
'em apart
she'd stop dead off with a jerk
Who's she
The train, of course
And you know the thing in the carriages where it says on it, 'Five
pounds' fine for improper use.' If you was to improperly use that, the
train 'ud stop
And if you used it properly
It 'ud stop just the same, I suppose
but it isn't proper
use unless you're being murdered. There was an old lady once -- someone
kidded her on it was a refreshment-room bell, and she used it improper,
not being in danger of her life, though hungry, and when the train
stopped and the guard came along expecting to find someone weltering in
their last moments, she says, 'Oh, please, Mister, I'll take a glass of
stout and a bath bun,' she says. And the train was seven minutes behind
her time as it was
What did the guard say to the old lady
_I_ dunno
but I lay she didn't forget it in a
hurry, whatever it was
Just as if coal had never been discovered
Yes
I knowed a young gent as used to take down the
numbers of every single one he seed; in a green note-book with silver
corners it was, owing to his father being very well-to-do in the
wholesale stationery
It has a few pages torn out
but it will hold quite a lot
of numbers, and when it's full I'll give you another. I'm so glad you
like the railway. Only, please, you mustn't walk on the line
Not if we face the way the train's coming
No -- really not
Mother, didn't YOU ever walk on the railway lines
when you were little
Yes
Well, then
But, darlings, you don't know how fond I am of you. What should I do if
you got hurt
Are you fonder of us than Granny was of you when you were little
No one
ever loved anyone more than my mother loved
me
What are you kicking me like that for, Bob
Very well, then. Only let me be sure you do know which way the trains
come -- and don't walk on the line near the tunnel or near corners
Trains keep to the left like carriages
so if we keep to
the right, we're bound to see them coming
Very well
If I was you, Mum
I should take and send for the
doctor. There's a lot of catchy complaints a-going about just now. My
sister's eldest -- she took a chill and it went to her inside, two years
ago come Christmas, and she's never been the same gell since
Now, Lady Grave-airs
I suppose you'll
want to be head-nurse
Of course
Well, then, I'll send down some medicine. Keep up a good fire. Have
some strong beef tea made ready to give her as soon as the fever goes
down. She can have grapes now, and beef essence -- and soda-water and
milk, and you'd better get in a bottle of brandy. The best brandy. Cheap
brandy is worse than poison
Nonsense
I can't afford all that rubbish. Tell Mrs. Viney to boil two pounds of
scrag-end of the neck for your dinners to-morrow, and I can have some
of the broth. Yes, I should like some more water now, love. And will you
get a basin and sponge my hands
And now
there's no one but us to do
anything, and we've got to do it. I've got the shilling for the mutton
We can do without the beastly mutton
bread and butter
will support life. People have lived on less on desert islands many a
time
Of course
But even if we never have anything to eat at all
you
can't get all those other things with our dinner money
No
we must find out some other way. Now
THINK, everybody, just as hard as ever you can
Mamma,
mamma
Oh -- ah, yes -- I think I was asleep
My poor little duck,
how tired you'll be -- I do hate to give you all this trouble
Trouble
Ah, don't cry, sweet
I shall be all right in a day or
two
Yes
Everything going on all right, little Nurse
Did you get the brandy
I've got the brandy
in a little flat bottle
I didn't see the grapes or the beef tea, though
No
but you will to-morrow. And there's some
beef stewing in the oven for beef tea
Who told you to do that
I noticed what Mother did when Phil had mumps
Right
Now you get your old woman to sit with your
mother, and then you eat a good breakfast, and go straight to bed and
sleep till dinner-time. We can't afford to have the head-nurse ill
Scenes from Palestine
Oh
I thought I'd missed you. My bootlaces would keep
coming down and I fell over them twice. Here, take it
Peter
Old gent
he asked me to fetch it up straight away
Thank you very much
I'm most awfully sorry I haven't got twopence to give you like Father
does, but
You drop it if you please
I wasn't
thinking about no tuppences. I only wanted to say I was sorry your Mamma
wasn't so well, and to ask how she finds herself this evening -- and
I've fetched her along a bit of sweetbrier, very sweet to smell it is.
Twopence indeed
just like a conjurer
Thank you very much
and I beg your pardon about the
twopence
No offence
Dear Roberta and Phyllis and Peter
here are the things you
want. Your mother will want to know where they came from. Tell her they
were sent by a friend who heard she was ill. When she is well again you
must tell her all about it, of course. And if she says you ought not to
have asked for the things, tell her that I say you were quite right,
and that I hope she will forgive me for taking the liberty of allowing
myself a very great pleasure
I think we WERE right
Right? Of course we were right
All the same
I don't
exactly look forward to telling Mother the whole truth about it
We're not to do it till she's well
and when she's well
we shall be so happy we shan't mind a little fuss like that. Oh, just
look at the roses! I must take them up to her
And the sweetbrier
don't forget
the sweetbrier
As if I should
Mother told me the other day there was
a thick hedge of it at her mother's house when she was a little girl
I'm sorry I was so angry, darlings, because I know you didn't
understand
We didn't mean to be naughty, Mammy
Now, listen
it's quite true that we're poor, but
we have enough to live on. You mustn't go telling everyone about our
affairs -- it's not right. And you must never, never, never ask strangers
to give you things. Now always remember that -- won't you
And I'll write a letter to your old gentleman, and I shall tell him
that I didn't approve -- oh, of course I shall thank him, too, for
his kindness. It's YOU I don't approve of, my darlings, not the old
gentleman. He was as kind as ever he could be. And you can give the
letter to the Station Master to give him -- and we won't say any more
about it
Isn't Mother splendid? You catch any other grown-up saying they were
sorry they had been angry
Yes
she IS splendid; but it's rather awful when she's
angry
She's like Avenging and Bright in the song
I should
like to look at her if it wasn't so awful. She looks so beautiful when
she's really downright furious
I thought you said you hadn't got any friends except in London
We've made him since
But he doesn't live hereabouts
No -- we just know him on the railway
And that just shows
that trains really ARE
dragons in disguise, with proper heads and tails
Alike
lor, love you, no,
Miss. No more alike nor what you an' me are. That little 'un without
a tender as went by just now all on her own, that was a tank, that
was -- she's off to do some shunting t'other side o' Maidbridge. That's as
it might be you, Miss. Then there's goods engines, great, strong things
with three wheels each side -- joined with rods to strengthen 'em -- as it
might be me. Then there's main-line engines as it might be this
'ere young gentleman when he grows up and wins all the races at 'is
school -- so he will. The main-line engine she's built for speed as well
as power. That's one to the 9.15 up
The Green Dragon
We calls her the Snail, Miss, among ourselves
She's
oftener be'ind'and nor any train on the line
But the engine's green
Yes, Miss
so's a snail some seasons o' the year
You aren't to see what we're going to do till it's done; it's a
glorious surprise
Oh, what a doctor's bill there'll be for this
get out of that
Hullo, head nurse! Want a lift
I wanted to see you
Your mother's not worse, I hope
No -- but
Well, skip in, then, and we'll go for a drive
This IS jolly
We could throw a stone down any one of your three chimneys
Yes
but you'd have to be a jolly good shot
How do you know I'm not
Now, then, what's the
trouble
Come, out with it
It's rather hard, you see
to out with it; because of
what Mother said
What DID Mother say
She said I wasn't to go telling everyone that we're poor. But you
aren't everyone, are you
Not at all
Well
Well, I know doctors are very extravagant -- I mean expensive, and Mrs.
Viney told me that her doctoring only cost her twopence a week because
she belonged to a Club
Yes
You see she told me what a good doctor you were, and I asked her how
she could afford you, because she's much poorer than we are. I've been
in her house and I know. And then she told me about the Club, and I
thought I'd ask you -- and -- oh, I don't want Mother to be worried! Can't
we be in the Club, too, the same as Mrs. Viney
You aren't cross with me, are you
Cross? How could I be? You're a very sensible little woman. Now look
here, don't you worry. I'll make it all right with your Mother, even if
I have to make a special brand-new Club all for her. Look here, this is
where the Aqueduct begins
What's an Aque -- what's its name
A water bridge
Look
It IS grand, isn't it
It's like pictures in the History of
Rome
Right
that's just exactly what it IS like.
The Romans were dead nuts on aqueducts. It's a splendid piece of
engineering
I thought engineering was making engines
Ah, there are different sorts of engineering -- making road and bridges
and tunnels is one kind. And making fortifications is another. Well, we
must be turning back. And, remember, you aren't to worry about doctor's
bills or you'll be ill yourself, and then I'll send you in a bill as
long as the aqueduct
There
that's to show the surprise is ready. Now
you wait till the bell rings again and then you may come into the
dining-room
Tinkle, tinkle
for a surprise
Three cheers for our
Bobbie
Now
look at your presents
And now look at the table
It's a map -- a map of the railway
Look -- those lilac
lines are the metals -- and there's the station done in brown wallflowers.
The laburnum is the train, and there are the signal-boxes, and the road
up to here -- and those fat red daisies are us three waving to the old
gentleman -- that's him, the pansy in the laburnum train
And there's 'Three Chimneys' done in the purple primroses
And that little tiny rose-bud is Mother looking out for us
when we're late for tea. Peter invented it all, and we got all the
flowers from the station. We thought you'd like it better
That's my present
Oh, Peter
not your
own dear little engine that you're so fond of
Oh, no
not the engine. Only the sweets
I mean not ALL the
engine. I'll let you go halves if you like
You're a brick
it's a splendid present
That was awfully jolly decent of Peter because I know he didn't mean
to. Well, the broken half shall be my half of the engine, and I'll get
it mended and give it back to Peter for his birthday
Yes, Mother
dear, I should like to cut the cake
You won't sit up late working, will you, Mother
She doesn't want me to know she's unhappy, and I won't know; I
won't know
I know what silk-worms feel like now
If you please
If you please, Mr. Engineer
And I've no business here. I'm an engine-burglar -- that's what I am
I shouldn't wonder if they could lock me up for this
Here's a bloomin' go
You're a naughty little gell, that's what you are
Daring little piece, I call her
Now, then
out with it. What do you mean by it,
eh
Oh, please
Try again
Please, Mr. Engineer
I did call out to you from the
line, but you didn't hear me -- and I just climbed up to touch you on the
arm -- quite gently I meant to do it -- and then I fell into the coals -- and
I am so sorry if I frightened you. Oh, don't be cross -- oh, please
don't
We ain't so much CROSS
as interested like. It
ain't every day a little gell tumbles into our coal bunker outer the
sky, is it, Bill? What did you DO it for -- eh
That's the point
what did you do it FOR
Here, cheer up, Mate. It ain't so bad
as all that 'ere, I'll be bound
I wanted
Mate
I only wanted to ask you if you'd be so kind as to mend this
I thought
that perhaps you'd mend this for
me -- because you're an engineer, you know
I'm blest if I ain't blowed
It's like your precious cheek
whatever made
you think we'd be bothered tinkering penny toys
I didn't mean it for precious cheek
only everybody that
has anything to do with railways is so kind and good, I didn't think
you'd mind. You don't really -- do you
My trade's driving of an engine, not mending her, especially such a
hout-size in engines as this 'ere
An' 'ow are we a-goin'
to get you back to your sorrowing friends and relations, and all be
forgiven and forgotten
If you'll put me down next time you stop
and
lend me the money for a third-class ticket, I'll pay you back -- honour
bright. I'm not a confidence trick like in the newspapers -- really, I'm
not
You're a little lady, every inch
We'll see you gets home safe. An' about this
engine -- Jim -- ain't you got ne'er a pal as can use a soldering iron?
Seems to me that's about all the little bounder wants doing to it
That's what Father said
What's that for
That's the injector
In -- what
Injector to fill up the boiler
Oh
that IS interesting
This 'ere's the automatic brake
You just move this 'ere little handle -- do it with one
finger, you can -- and the train jolly soon stops. That's what they call
the Power of Science in the newspapers
Where have you been
To the station, of course
Good-bye -- oh, good-bye
I shall always, always love you -- and Jim's second
cousin's wife's brother as well
like
herds of dream-elephants
It's like being in a besieged castle
look at the
arrows of the foe striking against the battlements
It's much more like a great garden-squirt
Perhaps it'll have stopped raining by then
anyhow, I'm
glad I brought Mother's waterproof and umbrella
Stand back, Mates
and horf she
goes
Oh
something's
happened! Come on
It's my belief he's nothing worse than a natural
If you ask me, I should say it was a Police Court case
Not it; the Infirmary more like
Now, then -- move along there. I'll attend to this, if YOU please
What's that he's saying
Sounds like French to me
It isn't French
What is it, then
I don't know what it is
but it isn't French. I know
that
No, it's not French
Try him with French if you know so much about it
Parlay voo Frongsay
There
there; THAT'S French
What does he say
I don't know
Here
you move on if you please. I'LL
deal with this case
No comprenny
Take him into your room
Mother can talk French. She'll be here by the next train from
Maidbridge
Oh, don't
don't you see how frightened he is? He thinks
you're going to shut him up. I know he does -- look at his eyes
They're like a fox's eyes when the beast's in a trap
Oh, let me try
I do really know one or two French
words if I could only think of them
Vous attendre. Ma mere parlez Francais. Nous -- what's the French for
'being kind
Nous etre bong pour vous
Here's a go
no ticket -- doesn't even know
where he wants to go. I'm not sure now but what I ought to send for the
police
Oh, DON'T
Wait till Mother comes
she does speak French
beautifully. You'd just love to hear her
I'm sure he hasn't done anything like you're sent to prison for
Looks like without visible means to me
Well, I don't mind giving him the benefit of the doubt till your Mamma
comes. I SHOULD like to know what nation's got the credit of HIM, that I
should
Look here
let's show him these
All right
He's Russian
or else he's like 'the man who was'-- in
Kipling, you know
I'll stay with him till you bring Mother in
You're not afraid, Missie
Oh, no
You wouldn't hurt me, would you
Well, Mum, what's it all about
Oh
it's all right. He's a Russian, and he's lost his
ticket. And I'm afraid he's very ill. If you don't mind, I'll take him
home with me now. He's really quite worn out. I'll run down and tell you
all about him to-morrow
I hope you won't find you're taking home a frozen viper
Oh, no
I'm quite sure I'm
not. Why, he's a great man in his own country, writes books -- beautiful
books -- I've read some of them; but I'll tell you all about it
to-morrow
You girls run home and light a fire in the sitting-room
and Peter had better go for the Doctor
I hate to tell you
but Mother's got a very
shabby Russian, and I'm sure he'll have to belong to your Club. I'm
certain he hasn't got any money. We found him at the station
Found him! Was he lost, then
Yes
that's just what he was. He's been
telling Mother the sad, sweet story of his life in French; and she said
would you be kind enough to come directly if you were at home. He has a
dreadful cough, and he's been crying
Oh, don't
please don't. You wouldn't if you'd seen him.
I never saw a man cry before. You don't know what it's like
The man seems worn out, mind and body
the
cough's bad, but there's nothing that can't be cured. He ought to go
straight to bed, though -- and let him have a fire at night
I'll make one in my room; it's the only one with a fireplace
Mother -- Daddy isn't -- isn't DEAD, is he
My darling, no! What made you think of anything so horrible
I -- I don't know
Daddy was quite, QUITE well when I heard
from him last
and he'll come back to us some day. Don't
fancy such horrible things, darling
Now, Mother, tell us all about the Russian gentleman
We have been patient
and I had to bite my tongue not to
go to sleep, and I just nearly went to sleep and I bit too hard, and it
hurts ever so. DO tell us. Make a nice long story of it
I can't make a long story of it to-night
I'm very
tired
Well, make it as long as you can
Well, it's a story long enough to make a whole book of. He's a writer;
he's written beautiful books. In Russia at the time of the Czar one
dared not say anything about the rich people doing wrong, or about the
things that ought to be done to make poor people better and happier. If
one did one was sent to prison
But they CAN'T
people only go to prison when they've
done wrong
Or when the Judges THINK they've done wrong
Yes, that's
so in England. But in Russia it was different. And he wrote a beautiful
book about poor people and how to help them. I've read it. There's
nothing in it but goodness and kindness. And they sent him to prison for
it. He was three years in a horrible dungeon, with hardly any light, and
all damp and dreadful. In prison all alone for three years
But, Mother
that can't be true NOW. It sounds like
something out of a history book -- the Inquisition, or something
It WAS true
it's all horribly true. Well, then they
took him out and sent him to Siberia, a convict chained to other
convicts -- wicked men who'd done all sorts of crimes -- a long chain of
them, and they walked, and walked, and walked, for days and weeks, till
he thought they'd never stop walking. And overseers went behind them
with whips -- yes, whips -- to beat them if they got tired. And some of them
went lame, and some fell down, and when they couldn't get up and go on,
they beat them, and then left them to die. Oh, it's all too terrible!
And at last he got to the mines, and he was condemned to stay there for
life -- for life, just for writing a good, noble, splendid book
How did he get away
When the war came, some of the Russian prisoners were allowed to
volunteer as soldiers. And he volunteered. But he deserted at the first
chance he got and
But that's very cowardly, isn't it
to desert? Especially
when it's war
Do you think he owed anything to a country that had done THAT to him?
If he did, he owed more to his wife and children. He didn't know what
had become of them
Oh
he had THEM to think about and be miserable about
TOO, then, all the time he was in prison
Yes, he had them to think about and be miserable about all the time he
was in prison. For anything he knew they might have been sent to prison,
too. They did those things in Russia. But while he was in the mines some
friends managed to get a message to him that his wife and children had
escaped and come to England. So when he deserted he came here to look
for them
Had he got their address
No; just England. He was going to London, and he thought he had to
change at our station, and then he found he'd lost his ticket and his
purse
Oh, DO you think he'll find them?-- I mean his wife and children, not
the ticket and things
I hope so. Oh, I hope and pray that he'll find his wife and children
again
Why, Mother
how very sorry you seem to be for him
Yes
Dears, when you say your prayers, I think you might
ask God to show His pity upon all prisoners and captives
To show His pity
upon all prisoners and
captives. Is that right, Mother
Yes
upon all prisoners and captives. All prisoners and
captives
You remember Perks promising me the very first strawberries out of his
own garden
Well, I should
think they're ripe now. Let's go down and see
Ighly honoured, I'm sure
Oh, dear
I do believe you're CROSS
What, me? Not me
it ain't nothing to me
What AIN'T nothing to you
Nothing ain't nothing. What 'appens either 'ere or elsewhere
if you likes to 'ave your secrets, 'ave 'em and welcome. That's
what I say
We haven't got any secrets from YOU
Maybe you 'ave, and maybe you 'aven't
it ain't nothing
to me. And I wish you all a very good afternoon
Oh, DON'T
this is truly dreadful! Whatever
it is, do tell us
We didn't mean to do it whatever it was
Look here
it's not fair. Even people who do
crimes aren't punished without being told what it's for -- as once they
were in Russia
I don't know nothing about Russia
Oh, yes, you do, when Mother came down on purpose to tell you and Mr.
Gills all about OUR Russian
Can't you fancy it
don't you see 'im
a-asking of me to step into 'is room and take a chair and listen to what
'er Ladyship 'as to say
Do you mean to say you've not heard
Not so much as a breath. I did go so far as to put a question. And he
shuts me up like a rat-trap. 'Affairs of State, Perks,' says he. But I
did think one o' you would 'a' nipped down to tell me -- you're here sharp
enough when you want to get anything out of old Perks
information about
locomotives or signals or the likes
We didn't know you didn't know
We thought Mother had told you
Wewantedtotellyouonlywethoughtitwouldbestalenews
Oh, let's kiss and be friends
we'll say we're sorry first,
if you like, but we didn't really know that you didn't know
We are so sorry
Well, I must say
Yes, it is pretty awful, isn't it
and I don't wonder you
were curious about who the Russian was
I wasn't curious, not so much as interested
Well, I do think Mr. Gills might have told you about it. It was horrid
of him
I don't keep no down on 'im for that, Missie
cos
why? I see 'is reasons. 'E wouldn't want to give away 'is own side with
a tale like that 'ere. It ain't human nature. A man's got to stand
up for his own side whatever they does. That's what it means by Party
Politics. I should 'a' done the same myself if that long-'aired chap 'ad
'a' been a Jap
But the Japs didn't do cruel, wicked things like that
P'r'aps not
still you can't be sure with
foreigners. My own belief is they're all tarred with the same brush
Then why were you on the side of the Japs
Well, you see, you must take one side or the other. Same as with
Liberals and Conservatives. The great thing is to take your side and
then stick to it, whatever happens
There's the 3.14 up
You lie low till she's through,
and then we'll go up along to my place, and see if there's any of them
strawberries ripe what I told you about
If there are any ripe, and you DO give them to me
you
won't mind if I give them to the poor Russian, will you
So it was them strawberries you come down for this afternoon, eh
no
Yes
it was
Well done
speak the truth and shame the
But we'd have come down the very next day if we'd known you hadn't
heard the story
I believe you, Missie
If it wasn't for the railway at the bottom, it would be as though the
foot of man had never been there, wouldn't it
We'd better get down
I'm sure the cherries would be
quite easy to get at from the side of the steps. You remember it was
there we picked the cherry blossoms that we put on the rabbit's grave
Hush. Stop! What's that
Look
the tree over there
It's moving
Oh, look! and so are the others. It's like
the woods in Macbeth
It's magic
I always knew this railway
was enchanted
What is it? Oh, what is it
it's much too magic for me.
I don't like it. Let's go home
It's ALL coming down
Oh
isn't it exactly like when coals
come in?-- if there wasn't any roof to the cellar and you could see
down
Look what a great mound it's made
Yes
Yes
The 11.29 down hasn't gone by yet. We must let them know at the
station, or there'll be a most frightful accident
Let's run
Come back
No time
it's two miles away, and it's past eleven
Couldn't we
couldn't we climb up a
telegraph post and do something to the wires
We don't know how
They do it in war
I know I've heard of it
They only CUT them, silly
and that doesn't do any good.
And we couldn't cut them even if we got up, and we couldn't get up. If
we had anything red, we could get down on the line and wave it
But the train wouldn't see us till it got round the corner, and then it
could see the mound just as well as us
better, because
it's much bigger than us
If we only had something red
we could go round the
corner and wave to the train
We might wave, anyway
They'd only think it was just US, as usual. We've waved so often
before. Anyway, let's get down
Oh, how hot I am
and I thought it was going to be cold; I
wish we hadn't put on our
our flannel petticoats
Oh, yes
THEY'RE red! Let's take them off
Now
You're not
you're not going to TEAR them
Shut up
Oh, yes
tear them into little bits if you like. Don't
you see, Phil, if we can't stop the train, there'll be a real live
accident, with people KILLED. Oh, horrible! Here, Peter, you'll never
tear it through the band
There
Now, we've got six flags
And we've got seven minutes. We must have flagstaffs
We must cut holes in the flags, and run the sticks through the holes
I shall have the other two myself
because it was my idea
to wave something red
They're our petticoats, though
Oh, what does it matter who waves what, if we can only save the train
I expect the watch is wrong, and the train's
gone by
Stand firm
and wave like mad! When it gets to that
big furze bush step back, but go on waving! Don't stand ON the line,
Bobbie
They don't see us! They won't see us! It's all no good
Keep off the line, you silly cuckoo
It's no good
Stand back
Not yet, not yet
Oh, stop, stop, stop
Gone right off in a faint
poor little woman. And no wonder.
I'll just 'ave a look at this 'ere mound of yours, and then we'll run
you back to the station and get her seen to
I believe that's what people look like when they're dead
DON'T
prompt action
common sense
ingenuity
You'll hear from the Company about this, I expect
Oh, come away, come away! I want to go home
Oh, listen
that's for US
Yes
I say, I am glad I thought about something red, and
waving it
How lucky we DID put on our red flannel petticoats
And it was US that saved them
How dreadful if they had all been killed
wouldn't it,
Bobbie
We never got any cherries, after all
Mother's unhappy. Why? I don't
know. She doesn't want me to know. I won't try to find out. But she
IS unhappy. Why? I don't know. She doesn't
helping lame dogs over stiles
loving-kindness
Good morning
Good night
Please
Thank you
Pretty
Ver' good
said his English
just
too sweet for anything
She likes to have someone to be good to, even beside us
And I know she hated to let him have Father's clothes. But I suppose it
'hurt nice,' or she wouldn't have
Secretary, Great Northern and Southern Railway Co
But if the presentation is money, you must say, 'Thank you, but we'd
rather not take it
I'll wash your Indian muslins at
once
You must look tidy on an occasion like this
Phil and I can wash them
if you'll iron them, Mother
Let's put the bath on the sink
then we can pretend
we're out-of-doors washerwomen like Mother saw in France
But they were washing in the cold river
not in hot water
This is a HOT river, then
lend a hand with the bath,
there's a dear
I should like to see a deer lending a hand
Now to rub and scrub and scrub and rub
Oh, no
you don't rub muslin. You put
the boiled soap in the hot water and make it all frothy-lathery -- and
then you shake the muslin and squeeze it, ever so gently, and all the
dirt comes out. It's only clumsy things like tablecloths and sheets that
have to be rubbed
It's a nice drying day -- that's one thing
Oh, I do wonder what wonderful feelings we shall have when we
WEAR the Indian muslin dresses
Yes, so do I
NOW we squeeze out the soapy water. NO -- we mustn't twist them -- and then
rinse them. I'll hold them while you and Peter empty the bath and get
clean water
A presentation! That means presents
Whatever will it be
It might be anything
what I've always wanted is a Baby
elephant -- but I suppose they wouldn't know that
Suppose it was gold models of steam-engines
Or a big model of the scene of the prevented accident
with a little model train, and dolls dressed like us and the
engine-driver and fireman and passengers
Do you LIKE
do you
LIKE us being rewarded for saving a train
Yes, I do
and don't you try to come it over
us that you don't like it, too. Because I know you do
Yes
I know I do. But oughtn't we to be
satisfied with just having done it, and not ask for anything more
Who did ask for anything more, silly
Victoria
Cross soldiers don't ASK for it; but they're glad enough to get it all
the same. Perhaps it'll be medals. Then, when I'm very old indeed, I
shall show them to my grandchildren and say, 'We only did our duty,' and
they'll be awfully proud of me
You have to be married
or you don't have any
grandchildren
I suppose I shall HAVE to be married some day
but it
will be an awful bother having her round all the time. I'd like to marry
a lady who had trances, and only woke up once or twice a year
Just to say you were the light of her life and then go to sleep again.
Yes. That wouldn't be bad
When _I_ get married
I shall want him to want me to be
awake all the time, so that I can hear him say how nice I am
I think it would be nice
to marry someone very poor,
and then you'd do all the work and he'd love you most frightfully, and
see the blue wood smoke curling up among the trees from the domestic
hearth as he came home from work every night. I say -- we've got to answer
that letter and say that the time and place WILL be convenient to us.
There's the soap, Peter. WE'RE both as clean as clean. That pink box of
writing paper you had on your birthday, Phil
Dear Mr. Jabez Inglewood,-- Thank you very much. We did not want to be
rewarded but only to save the train, but we are glad you think so and
thank you very much. The time and place you say will be quite convenient
to us. Thank you very much.

          "Your affecate little friend
P.S. Thank you very much
Washing is much easier than ironing
I do love to see things come clean. Oh -- I don't
know how we shall wait till it's time to know what presentation they're
going to present
Hear, hear
From the Directors of the Northern and Southern Railway in grateful
recognition of the courageous and prompt action which averted an
accident on --- 1905
You must make a speech now and thank everyone for their kindness
Thank you
Oh, dear
Ladies and Gentlemen
Ladies and
Gentlemen
it's most awfully good of you, and
we shall treasure the watches all our lives -- but really we don't deserve
it because what we did wasn't anything, really. At least, I mean it
was awfully exciting, and what I mean to say -- thank you all very, very
much
I did want to talk to the old gentleman about something else
but it was so public -- like being in church
What did you want to say
I'll tell you when I've thought about it more
My dearest old gentleman
I want most awfully to ask you
something. If you could get out of the train and go by the next, it
would do. I do not want you to give me anything. Mother says we ought
not to. And besides, we do not want any THINGS. Only to talk to you
about a Prisoner and Captive. Your loving little friend,

          "Bobbie
like any little gutter child
Perhaps the old gentleman won't notice
The aged are
often weak in the eyes
Oh
my heart's thumping like a steam-engine -- right
under my sash, too
Nonsense
people's hearts aren't under their sashes
I don't care -- mine is
If you're going to talk like a poetry-book
my heart's in
my mouth
My heart's in my boots -- if you come to that
but do
come on -- he'll think we're idiots
He won't be far wrong
Hullo
This is a very
great pleasure
It WAS good of you to get out
Well
Well? What is
it
Oh, please
Yes
What I mean to say
Well
It's all very nice and kind
But
I wish I might say something
Say it
Well, then
And what we want more than anything in the world is to find his wife
and children for him
but we don't know how. But you must
be most horribly clever, or you wouldn't be a Direction of the Railway.
And if YOU knew how -- and would? We'd rather have that than anything else
in the world. We'd go without the watches, even, if you could sell them
and find his wife with the money
Hum
what did you say the name
was -- Fryingpansky
No, no
I'll write it down for you. It doesn't
really look at all like that except when you say it. Have you a bit of
pencil and the back of an envelope
Here
write here
Szezcpansky
That's how you write it. You CALL it Shepansky
THAT man? Bless my soul
Why, I've read his book! It's
translated into every European language. A fine book -- a noble book. And
so your mother took him in -- like the good Samaritan. Well, well. I'll
tell you what, youngsters -- your mother must be a very good woman
Of course she is
And you're a very good man
You flatter me
And now am I to tell you what I think of you
Oh, please don't
Why
I don't exactly know
Only -- if it's horrid, I don't want
you to; and if it's nice, I'd rather you didn't
Well, then
I'll only just say that I'm very glad you came
to me about this -- very glad, indeed. And I shouldn't be surprised if I
found out something very soon. I know a great many Russians in London,
and every Russian knows HIS name. Now tell me all about yourselves
Tell me all about yourself
All right, we'll have an examination
you two
sit on the table, and I'll sit on the bench and ask questions
Afternoon tea
Bless my soul
Yes
It's very thoughtful of you
very
But you might have got a cup
and a plate
Perks always drinks out of the can
I
think it was very nice of him to give it me at all -- let alone cups and
plates
So do I
Well
it's my belief
that we've lighted a candle to-day -- like Latimer, you know, when he was
being burned -- and there'll be fireworks for our Russian before long
Who on earth
Let's go and see
Hullo
Hullo
How do you do
Good news
I've found your Russian friend's wife and
child -- and I couldn't resist the temptation of giving myself the
pleasure of telling him
Here
you run on and tell him. The other two will
show me the way
I don't know how to thank you for EVERYTHING. It has been a real
pleasure to me to see you. But we live very quietly. I am so sorry that
I can't ask you to come and see us again
I consider myself very fortunate, Madam, to have been received once at
your house
Ah
I know I must seem surly and ungrateful -- but
You could never seem anything but a most charming and gracious lady
How tired you look, Mammy
lean on me
It's my place to give Mother my arm
I'm the head man of
the family when Father's away
How awfully nice
to think of the
dear Russian embracing his long-lost wife. The baby must have grown a
lot since he saw it
Yes
I wonder whether Father will think I'VE grown
I have grown already, haven't I, Mother
Yes
oh, yes
Poor old Mammy, you ARE tired
Come on, Phil; I'll race you to the gate
That's a likely little brooch you've got on, Miss
I don't know as ever I see a thing more like a buttercup
without it WAS a buttercup
Yes
I always thought
it was more like a buttercup almost than even a real one -- and I NEVER
thought it would come to be mine, my very own -- and then Mother gave it
to me for my birthday
Oh, have you had a birthday
Yes
when's your birthday, Mr. Perks
My birthday
I give up keeping of my birthday afore you was
born
But you must have been born SOMETIME, you know
even if it was twenty years ago -- or thirty or sixty or
seventy
Not so long as that, Missie
If you
really want to know, it was thirty-two years ago, come the fifteenth of
this month
Then why don't you keep it
I've got something else to keep besides birthdays
Oh! What
Not secrets
No
the kids and the Missus
It seems horrid that nobody keeps his birthday
Couldn't
WE do something
Let's go up to the Canal bridge and talk it over
I got a
new gut line from the postman this morning. He gave it me for a bunch of
roses that I gave him for his sweetheart. She's ill
Then I do think you might have given her the roses for nothing
Nyang, nyang
He did, of course
directly we heard she was
ill we got the roses ready and waited by the gate. It was when you were
making the brekker-toast. And when he'd said 'Thank you' for the roses
so many times -- much more than he need have -- he pulled out the line and
gave it to Peter. It wasn't exchange. It was the grateful heart
Oh, I BEG your pardon, Peter
I AM so sorry
Don't mention it
I knew you would be
Never mind
Let's just stay here and look at things.
Everything's so beautiful
It's all right
but somehow I can always see how pretty
things are much better when I've something to do. Let's get down on to
the towpath and fish from there
Oh, nonsense
There aren't any boys here now. If there
were, I'd fight them
All right,
then
Hi
get out of that,
can't you
We'll slip down again when they've gone by
She's going to anchor
just our luck
What you staring at
We weren't staring
we wouldn't be so rude
Rude be blessed
get along with you
Get along yourself
We've as
much right here as anyone else
Oh, 'AVE you, indeed
We'll soon see about that
Oh, come away, Peter, come away
Not me
but YOU'D better
Now, then, what do you mean by it? Don't you know these 'ere waters is
preserved? You ain't no right catching fish 'ere -- not to say nothing of
your precious cheek
I WASN'T catching fish
That's not YOUR fault, I'll be bound
Who are you a-shoving of
Oh
I'm not shoving anybody. At least, not
on purpose. Please don't be cross with Peter. Of course, if it's your
canal, we're sorry and we won't any more. But we didn't know it was
yours
Go along with you
Yes, we will; indeed we will
but we do beg
your pardon -- and really we haven't caught a single fish. I'd tell you
directly if we had, honour bright I would
Well
cut along, then, and don't you do
it again, that's all
Chuck us a coat, M'ria
You'll find me up at the 'Rose and Crown' when you've got the kid to
sleep
The canal may belong to him
though I don't believe it
does. But the bridge is everybody's. Doctor Forrest told me it's public
property. I'm not going to be bounced off the bridge by him or anyone
else, so I tell you
I do wish you wouldn't
Go home if you're afraid
leave me alone. I'M not
afraid
I'm not going to be driven away by any old bargeman, I'm not
Of course not
you didn't give in to him! So
now we might go home, don't you think
NO
Ahem
You mustn't take no notice of my Bill
is bark's
worse'n 'is bite. Some of the kids down Farley way is fair terrors. It
was them put 'is back up calling out about who ate the puppy-pie under
Marlow bridge
Who DID
_I_ dunno
Nobody don't know! But somehow, and I
don't know the why nor the wherefore of it, them words is p'ison to a
barge-master. Don't you take no notice. 'E won't be back for two hours
good. You might catch a power o' fish afore that. The light's good an'
all
Thank you
You're very kind. Where's your baby
Asleep in the cabin
E's all right. Never wakes
afore twelve. Reg'lar as a church clock, 'e is
I'm sorry
I would have liked to see him, close to
And a finer you never did see, Miss, though I says it
Aren't you afraid to leave it
Lor' love you, no
who'd hurt a little thing like
'im? Besides, Spot's there. So long
Shall we go home
You can. I'm going to fish
I thought we came up here to talk about Perks's birthday
Perks's birthday'll keep
What's that
It's on fire -- that's all
Serve him right
Oh -- how CAN you
Think of the poor dear dog
The BABY
Not you
ME, because I'm wet
No -- not you -- ME
It's all right, hardly any fire at all
Hi
Hi, Baby -- where are you
Oh, let ME go
I've got the kid
I'm bound to bark and bite if strangers come into my master's cabin,
but I know you mean well, so I won't REALLY bite
All right, old man. Good dog
Here -- give me the baby,
Peter; you're so wet you'll give it cold
Now
you run straight to the 'Rose and Crown'
and tell them. Phil and I will stay here with the precious. Hush, then,
a dear, a duck, a darling! Go NOW, Peter! Run
I can't run in these things
they're as heavy as
lead. I'll walk
Then I'LL run
Get on the bank, Phil, and I'll hand you
the dear
Rose
and Crown
And 'e sent down word 'paint her inside hout,' not namin' no colour,
d'ye see? So I gets a lotter green paint and I paints her stem to stern,
and I tell yer she looked A1. Then 'E comes along and 'e says, 'Wot yer
paint 'er all one colour for?' 'e says. And I says, says I, 'Cause I
thought she'd look fust-rate,' says I, 'and I think so still.' An' he
says, 'DEW yer? Then ye can just pay for the bloomin' paint yerself,'
says he. An' I 'ad to, too
Bill! I want Bill the Bargeman
Oh
Your barge
cabin's on fire. Go quickly
Reginald Horace
my Reginald Horace
All right
if you mean the baby; got him out safe. Dog,
too
Go on -- it's all alight
second wind
Don't
I'd just got him to sleep
Lord help me, if it was me left anything as could catch alight
Ye be here at seven to-morrow
and I'll take you the
entire trip to Farley and back, so I will, and not a penny to pay.
Nineteen locks
It was simply ripping, Mother
right over that glorious aqueduct.
And locks -- you don't know what they're like. You sink into the ground
and then, when you feel you're never going to stop going down, two great
black gates open slowly, slowly -- you go out, and there you are on the
canal just like you were before
I know
there are locks on the Thames. Father and I used
to go on the river at Marlow before we were married
And the dear, darling, ducky baby
it let me nurse it
for ages and ages -- and it WAS so good. Mother, I wish we had a baby to
play with
And everybody was so nice to us
everybody we met. And
they say we may fish whenever we like. And Bill is going to show us the
way next time he's in these parts. He says we don't know really
He said YOU didn't know
but, Mother, he said he'd tell
all the bargees up and down the canal that we were the real, right sort,
and they were to treat us like good pals, as we were
So then I said
we'd always each wear a red
ribbon when we went fishing by the canal, so they'd know it was US, and
we were the real, right sort, and be nice to us
So you've made another lot of friends
first the railway
and then the canal
Oh, yes
I think everyone in the world is friends if you
can only get them to see you don't want to be UN-friends
Perhaps you're right
Come, Chicks. It's
bedtime
Yes
Oh dear -- and we went up there to talk about what
we'd do for Perks's birthday. And we haven't talked a single thing about
it
No more we have
but Peter's saved Reginald Horace's
life. I think that's about good enough for one evening
Bobbie would have saved him if I hadn't knocked her down; twice I did
So would I
if I'd known what to do
Yes
you've saved a little child's life. I do think
that's enough for one evening. Oh, my darlings, thank God YOU'RE all
safe
I've sold another story, Chickies
the one about the King
of the Mussels, so there'll be buns for tea. You can go and get them as
soon as they're baked. About eleven, isn't it
Mother, would you mind if we didn't have the buns for tea to-night, but
on the fifteenth? That's next Thursday
_I_ don't mind when you have them, dear
but why
Because it's Perks's birthday
he's thirty-two, and
he says he doesn't keep his birthday any more, because he's got other
things to keep -- not rabbits or secrets -- but the kids and the missus
You mean his wife and children
Yes
it's the same thing, isn't it
And we thought we'd make a nice birthday for him. He's been so awfully
jolly decent to us, you know, Mother
and we agreed that
next bun-day we'd ask you if we could
But suppose there hadn't been a bun-day before the fifteenth
Oh, then, we meant to ask you to let us anti -- antipate it, and go
without when the bun-day came
Anticipate
I see. Certainly. It would be nice to put
his name on the buns with pink sugar, wouldn't it
Perks
it's not a pretty name
His other name's Albert
I asked him once
We might put A. P
I'll show you how when the day
comes
There are always flowers, of course
He's got lots of flowers of his own
But it's always nice to have them given you
however
many you've got of your own. We can use flowers for trimmings to the
birthday. But there must be something to trim besides buns
Let's all be quiet and think
no one's to speak until
it's thought of something
Hooray
I've got it
What
Why, Perks is so nice to everybody. There must be lots of people in the
village who'd like to help to make him a birthday. Let's go round and
ask everybody
Mother said we weren't to ask people for things
For ourselves, she meant, silly, not for other people. I'll ask the old
gentleman too. You see if I don't
Let's ask Mother first
Oh, what's the use of bothering Mother about every little thing
especially when she's busy. Come on. Let's go down to the
village now and begin
No
I should like everyone to have one. Only we know
when his is
Mine's to-morrow
and much notice anyone will take
of it. Go along with you
For Mrs.
Ransome, with our best love, because it is her birthday
There's no harm in it
but it depends HOW you do it. I
only hope he won't be offended and think it's CHARITY. Poor people are
very proud, you know
It isn't because he's poor
it's because we're fond of
him
I'll find some things that Phyllis has outgrown
if
you're quite sure you can give them to him without his being offended. I
should like to do some little thing for him because he's been so kind to
you. I can't do much because we're poor ourselves. What are you writing,
Bobbie
Nothing particular
I'm sure he'd like the things, Mother
Good morning
Here, stop a bit
Those roses
Did you like them
they were as fresh as fresh. _I_
made the needle-book, but it was Bobbie's present
Here's your basket
I dare say Perks's children would like them
You ARE an old dear
Perks WILL be pleased
He won't be half so pleased as I was with your needle-book and the tie
and the pretty flowers and all
You're good little souls, that you are. Look here. I've got a
pram round the back in the wood-lodge. It was got for my Emmie's first,
that didn't live but six months, and she never had but that one. I'd
like Mrs. Perks to have it. It 'ud be a help to her with that great boy
of hers. Will you take it along
OH
Well, there it is. I don't know but what I'd have given it to her
before if I'd thought of it. Only I didn't quite know if she'd accept of
it from me. You tell her it was my Emmie's little one's pram
Oh, ISN'T it nice to think there is going to be a real live baby in it
again
Yes
here, I'll give
you some peppermint cushions for the little ones, and then you run along
before I give you the roof off my head and the clothes off my back
Mother's a-changing of herself
Down in a minute
I'm a bit late changing, Miss
owing to me having
had a extry clean-up to-day, along o' Perks happening to name its being
his birthday. I don't know what put it into his head to think of such
a thing. We keeps the children's birthdays, of course; but him and
me -- we're too old for such like, as a general rule
We knew it was his birthday
and we've got some presents
for him outside in the perambulator
Oh, don't
oh, please don't
What on earth is the matter? You don't
mean to say you don't like it
DON'T you like it
There, there, don't you mind me. I'M all right
Like it?
Why, it's a birthday such as Perks never 'ad, not even when 'e was a boy
and stayed with his uncle, who was a corn chandler in his own account.
He failed afterwards. Like it? Oh
Look here, we're glad you're pleased. But if you go
on saying things like that, we must go home. And we did want to stay and
see if Mr. Perks is pleased, too. But we can't stand this
I won't say another single word
but that needn't stop me thinking, need it? For if ever
Can we have a plate for the buns
fit for a
Prince
To think
me getting the place tidy early, and the little
'uns getting the wild-flowers and all -- when never did I think there'd be
anything more for him except the ounce of his pet particular that I
got o' Saturday and been saving up for 'im ever since. Bless us! 'e IS
early
Oh
let's hide in the back kitchen, and YOU tell
him about it. But give him the tobacco first, because you got it for
him. And when you've told him, we'll all come in and shout, 'Many happy
returns
Hullo, old woman
here's a pretty
set-out
It's your birthday tea, Bert
and here's a ounce of
your extry particular. I got it o' Saturday along o' your happening to
remember it was your birthday to-day
Good old girl
But what's that pram doing here? And what's all these bundles? And
where did you get the sweetstuff, and
Oh
whatever shall we do? I forgot to
put the labels on any of the things! He won't know what's from who.
He'll think it's all US, and that we're trying to be grand or charitable
or something horrid
Hush
I don't care
I won't stand it, and so I tell you straight
But
it's them children you make such a fuss
about -- the children from the Three Chimneys
I don't care
not if it was a angel from Heaven.
We've got on all right all these years and no favours asked. I'm not
going to begin these sort of charity goings-on at my time of life, so
don't you think it, Nell
Oh, hush
Bert, shut your silly tongue, for
goodness' sake. The all three of 'ems in the wash-house a-listening to
every word you speaks
Then I'll give them something to listen to
I've spoke my mind to them afore now, and I'll do it again
Come out
come out and tell me what you mean by it. 'Ave
I ever complained to you of being short, as you comes this charity lay
over me
OH
I thought you'd be so pleased; I'll never try to be
kind to anyone else as long as I live. No, I won't, not never
We didn't mean any harm
It ain't what you means so much as what you does
Oh, DON'T
We thought you'd
love it. We always have things on our birthdays
Oh, yes
your own relations; that's different
Oh, no
NOT our own relations. All the servants
always gave us things at home, and us to them when it was their
birthdays. And when it was mine, and Mother gave me the brooch like a
buttercup, Mrs. Viney gave me two lovely glass pots, and nobody thought
she was coming the charity lay over us
If it had been glass pots here
I wouldn't ha' said so
much. It's there being all this heaps and heaps of things I can't stand.
No -- nor won't, neither
But they're not all from us
only we forgot to put the
labels on. They're from all sorts of people in the village
Who put 'em up to it, I'd like to know
Why, we did
So you've been round telling the neighbours we can't make both
ends meet? Well, now you've disgraced us as deep as you can in the
neighbourhood, you can just take the whole bag of tricks back w'ere it
come from. Very much obliged, I'm sure. I don't doubt but what you meant
it kind, but I'd rather not be acquainted with you any longer if it's
all the same to you
Look here
this is most awful
That's what I says
Look here
we'll go if you like -- and you
needn't be friends with us any more if you don't want, but
WE shall always be friends with YOU, however nasty you are to us
Be quiet
But before we go
do let us show you the
labels we wrote to put on the things
I don't want to see no labels
except proper luggage ones
in my own walk of life. Do you think I've kept respectable and outer
debt on what I gets, and her having to take in washing, to be give away
for a laughing-stock to all the neighbours
Laughing
you don't know
You're a very hasty gentleman
you know you were
wrong once before, about us not telling you the secret about the
Russian. Do let Bobbie tell you about the labels
Well. Go ahead
Well, then
we wrote down all the things everybody said
when they gave us the things, with the people's names, because Mother
said we ought to be careful -- because -- but I wrote down what she
said -- and you'll see
Don't you upset yourself, Missy. _I_ know you meant it kind if he
doesn't
May I read the labels
Mother's first. It says:--

"'Little Clothes for Mrs. Perks's children.' Mother said, 'I'll find
some of Phyllis's things that she's grown out of if you're quite sure
Mr. Perks wouldn't be offended and think it's meant for charity. I'd
like to do some little thing for him, because he's so kind to you. I
can't do much because we're poor ourselves
That's all right
your Ma's a born lady. We'll keep the
little frocks, and what not, Nell
Then there's the perambulator and the gooseberries, and the sweets
they're from Mrs. Ransome. She said: 'I dare say Mr.
Perks's children would like the sweets. And the perambulator was got for
my Emmie's first -- it didn't live but six months, and she's never had but
that one. I'd like Mrs. Perks to have it. It would be a help with her
fine boy. I'd have given it before if I'd been sure she'd accept of
it from me.' She told me to tell you
that it was her
Emmie's little one's pram
I can't send that pram back, Bert
and I
won't. So don't you ask me
I'm not a-asking anything
Then the shovel
Mr. James made it for you himself. And
he said -- where is it? Oh, yes, here! He said, 'You tell Mr. Perks it's a
pleasure to make a little trifle for a man as is so much respected,' and
then he said he wished he could shoe your children and his own children,
like they do the horses, because, well, he knew what shoe leather was
James is a good enough chap
Then the honey
and the boot-laces. HE said
he respected a man that paid his way -- and the butcher said the same. And
the old turnpike woman said many was the time you'd lent her a hand
with her garden when you were a lad -- and things like that came home to
roost -- I don't know what she meant. And everybody who gave anything said
they liked you, and it was a very good idea of ours; and nobody said
anything about charity or anything horrid like that. And the old
gentleman gave Peter a gold pound for you, and said you were a man who
knew your work. And I thought you'd LOVE to know how fond people are
of you, and I never was so unhappy in my life. Good-bye. I hope you'll
forgive us some day
Stop
I take back every word
I've said contrary to what you'd wish. Nell, set on the kettle
We'll take the things away if you're unhappy about them
but I think everybody'll be most awfully disappointed, as well as us
I'm not unhappy about them
I don't know
I don't know as ever I was better pleased. Not so much
with the presents -- though they're an A1 collection -- but the kind respect
of our neighbours. That's worth having, eh, Nell
I think it's all worth having
and you've made a
most ridiculous fuss about nothing, Bert, if you ask me
No, I ain't
if a man didn't respect hisself, no
one wouldn't do it for him
But everyone respects you
they all said so
I knew you'd like it when you really understood
Humph! You'll stay to tea
May the garland of
friendship be ever green
Jolly good little kids, those
Oh, they're all right, bless their hearts
it's you
that's the aggravatingest old thing that ever was. I was ashamed of
you -- I tell you
You didn't need to be, old gal. I climbed down handsome soon as I
understood it wasn't charity. But charity's what I never did abide, and
won't neither
Yes
it's not so much what you does as what
you means; that's what I say. Now if it had been charity
Oh, drat charity
nobody won't offer you
charity, Bert, however much you was to want it, I lay. That was just
friendliness, that was
It
WAS friendliness, wasn't it, Sir
I think
it was what is sometimes called
loving-kindness
Here's your tea, Mother-love
do drink it while it's
hot
Poor dear head
does it ache
No -- yes -- not much
Bobbie, do you think Peter and Phil
are FORGETTING Father
NO
Why
You none of you ever speak of him now
We often talk about him when we're by ourselves
But not to me
Why
I -- you
Bobbie, come here
Now
try to tell me, dear
Tell Mother
Well, then
I thought you were so unhappy about Daddy
not being here, it made you worse when I talked about him. So I stopped
doing it
And the others
I don't know about the others
I never said anything
about THAT to them. But I expect they felt the same about it as me
Bobbie dear
I'll
tell you. Besides parting from Father, he and I have had a great
sorrow -- oh, terrible -- worse than anything you can think of, and at first
it did hurt to hear you all talking of him as if everything were just
the same. But it would be much more terrible if you were to forget him.
That would be worse than anything
The trouble
I promised I
would never ask you any questions, and I never have, have I? But -- the
trouble -- it won't last always
No
the worst will be over when Father comes home to
us
I wish I could comfort you
Oh, my dear, do you suppose you don't? Do you think I haven't noticed
how good you've all been, not quarrelling nearly as much as you used
to -- and all the little kind things you do for me -- the flowers, and
cleaning my shoes, and tearing up to make my bed before I get time to do
it myself
That's nothing
to what
I MUST get on with my work
Don't say anything to the others
Uncle Edward died before he was grown up, didn't he
Yes, dear
you would have loved him. He was such a
brave boy, and so adventurous. Always in mischief, and yet friends with
everybody in spite of it. And your Uncle Reggie's in Ceylon -- yes, and
Father's away, too. But I think they'd all like to think we'd enjoyed
talking about the things they used to do. Don't you think so
Not Uncle Edward
he's in Heaven
You don't suppose he's forgotten us and all the old times, because God
has taken him, any more than I forget him. Oh, no, he remembers. He's
only away for a little time. We shall see him some day
And Uncle Reggie -- and Father, too
Yes
Uncle Reggie and Father, too. Good night, my
darlings
Good night
Oh, I do love you so, Mummy -- I
do -- I do
I mustn't try to think what it is
no, I mustn't. I
AM glad Mother noticed about us not quarrelling so much. We'll keep that
up
I can't weed for fear I pull up the wrong things
it saves such a lot of work
Only good for bonfires, Miss
You just dig 'em up and burn
'em, and I'll give you some nice fresh roots outer my garden; pansies,
and stocks, and sweet willies, and forget-me-nots. I'll bring 'em along
to-morrow if you get the ground ready
_I_ was using the rake
Well, I'm using it now
But I had it first
Then it's my turn now
You're always being disagreeable about nothing
I had the rake first
Don't -- I tell you I said this morning I meant to have it. Didn't I,
Phil
If you remember, you ought to say
Of course she doesn't remember -- but she might say so
I wish I'd had a brother instead of two whiny little kiddy sisters
I can't think why little boys were ever invented
You don't quarrel like you used to do
OH
What's the matter
Don't let's quarrel. Mother hates it so
Take the horrid rake, then
Serve you right
What happened, Bobbie
It was the rake
Peter was pulling at it, so was
Bobbie, and she let go and he went over
Stop that noise, Peter
Come. Stop at once
Now
are you hurt
If he was really hurt, he wouldn't make such a fuss
he's not a coward
I think my foot's broken off, that's all
He IS hurt
he's fainted. Here, Bobbie, sit down and take
his head on your lap
Run for water -- a basinful
It's all I can do
Oh, suppose Peter should die, or
be a helpless cripple for life, or have to walk with crutches, or wear a
boot with a sole like a log of wood
I wish I'd never been born
Why, lawk a mercy, what's that for
Oh, it's you
Peter's hurt his foot with a rake -- three
great gaping wounds, like soldiers get. And it was partly my fault
That it wasn't, I'll go bail
Doctor seen him
Phyllis has gone for the Doctor
He'll be all right; you see if he isn't
Why, my father's
second cousin had a hay-fork run into him, right into his inside, and he
was right as ever in a few weeks, all except his being a bit weak in
the head afterwards, and they did say that it was along of his getting
a touch of the sun in the hay-field, and not the fork at all. I remember
him well. A kind-'earted chap, but soft, as you might say
Well
you won't want to be bothered with gardening just
this minute, I dare say. You show me where your garden is, and I'll
pop the bits of stuff in for you. And I'll hang about, if I may make so
free, to see the Doctor as he comes out and hear what he says. You cheer
up, Missie. I lay a pound he ain't hurt, not to speak of
He won't be lame, or have to wear crutches or a lump on his foot, will
he
My aunt! No
he'll be as nimble as ever on his pins
in a fortnight. Don't you worry, little Mother Goose
He says you won't be lame or anything
Oh, course I shan't, silly
Oh, Peter, I AM so sorry
That's all right
It was ALL my fault
Rot
If we hadn't quarrelled, it wouldn't have happened. I knew it was wrong
to quarrel. I wanted to say so, but somehow I couldn't
Don't drivel
I shouldn't have stopped if you HAD said
it. Not likely. And besides, us rowing hadn't anything to do with it.
I might have caught my foot in the hoe, or taken off my fingers in the
chaff-cutting machine or blown my nose off with fireworks. It would have
been hurt just the same whether we'd been rowing or not
But I knew it was wrong to quarrel
and now
you're hurt and
Now look here
you just dry up. If you're not
careful, you'll turn into a beastly little Sunday-school prig, so I tell
you
I don't mean to be a prig. But it's so hard not to be when you're
really trying to be good
Not it
it's a jolly good thing it wasn't you was hurt.
I'm glad it was ME. There! If it had been you, you'd have been lying
on the sofa looking like a suffering angel and being the light of the
anxious household and all that. And I couldn't have stood it
No, I shouldn't
Yes, you would
I tell you I shouldn't
I tell you you would
Oh, children
Quarrelling again?
Already
We aren't quarrelling -- not really
I wish you wouldn't
think it's rows every time we don't agree
Peter, I AM sorry you're hurt. But you ARE a beast to say I'm a prig
Well
perhaps I am. You did say I wasn't a
coward, even when you were in such a wax. The only thing is -- don't
you be a prig, that's all. You keep your eyes open and if you feel
priggishness coming on just stop in time. See
Yes
I see
Then let's call it Pax
bury the hatchet
in the fathoms of the past. Shake hands on it. I say, Bobbie, old chap,
I am tired
he's not a
coward
I do wish there was something to read
I've read all our
books fifty times over
I'll go to the Doctor's
he's sure to have some
Only about how to be ill, and about people's nasty insides, I expect
Perks has a whole heap of Magazines that came out of trains when people
are tired of them
I'll run down and ask him
And how's the young gent
Better, thanks
but he's most frightfully bored. I came
to ask if you'd got any Magazines you could lend him
There, now
why didn't I think of that, now? I was
trying to think of something as 'ud amuse him only this morning, and I
couldn't think of anything better than a guinea-pig. And a young chap I
know's going to fetch that over for him this tea-time
How lovely! A real live guinea! He will be pleased. But he'd like the
Magazines as well
That's just it
I've just sent the pick of 'em to
Snigson's boy -- him what's just getting over the pewmonia. But I've lots
of illustrated papers left
There
I'll just slip a bit of string and a bit of paper
round 'em
There
there's lots of pictures, and if he likes to mess 'em
about with his paint-box, or coloured chalks or what not, why, let him.
_I_ don't want 'em
You're a dear
So now I know
End of the Trial. Verdict. Sentence
Guilty
Five years' Penal
Servitude
Oh, Daddy
it's not true -- I
don't believe it. You never did it! Never, never, never
What is it
It's me
tea's ready, and a boy's brought
Peter a guinea-pig. Come along down
My darling
whatever IS
the matter
My head aches, rather
Has anything gone wrong
I'm all right, really
NOT before the
others
More bread and butter, please
She's gone to own up
I wonder what she's
done
Broken something, I suppose
but she needn't be so silly
over it. Mother never rows for accidents. Listen! Yes, they're going
upstairs. She's taking Mother up to show her -- the water-jug with storks
on it, I expect it is
What is it
Come upstairs, come up where nobody can hear us
I know all
All is known to me
The terrible secret is
a secret no longer
Oh, Mammy, oh, Mammy,
oh, Mammy
Oh, Bobbie
you don't BELIEVE it? You don't believe Daddy did it
NO
That's all right
It's not true. And they've shut him
up in prison, but he's done nothing wrong. He's good and noble and
honourable, and he belongs to us. We have to think of that, and be proud
of him, and wait
Daddy
Oh, Daddy, oh, Daddy, oh, Daddy
Why didn't you tell me, Mammy
Are you going to tell the others
No
Why
Because
Exactly
so you understand why I didn't tell you. We two
must help each other to be brave
Yes
Mother, will it make you more unhappy if you tell
me all about it? I want to understand
all
about it
Oh, how could they look at him and believe it
and how
could ANY one do such a thing
SOMEONE did it
and all the evidence was against Father.
Those letters
Yes. How did the letters get into his desk
Someone put them there. And the person who put them there was the
person who was really guilty
HE must be feeling pretty awful all this time
I don't believe he had any feelings
he couldn't
have done a thing like that if he had
Perhaps he just shoved the letters into the desk to hide them when he
thought he was going to be found out. Why don't you tell the lawyers,
or someone, that it must have been that person? There wasn't anyone that
would have hurt Father on purpose, was there
I don't know -- I don't know. The man under him who got Daddy's place
when he -- when the awful thing happened -- he was always jealous of your
Father because Daddy was so clever and everyone thought such a lot of
him. And Daddy never quite trusted that man
Couldn't we explain all that to someone
Nobody will listen
nobody at all. Do you
suppose I've not tried everything? No, my dearest, there's nothing to be
done. All we can do, you and I and Daddy, is to be brave, and patient,
and
to pray, Bobbie, dear
Mother, you've got very thin
A little, perhaps
And oh
I do think you're the bravest person in the
world as well as the nicest
We won't talk of all this any more, will we, dear
we
must bear it and be brave. And, darling, try not to think of it. Try to
be cheerful, and to amuse yourself and the others. It's much easier for
me if you can be a little bit happy and enjoy things. Wash your poor
little round face, and let's go out into the garden for a bit
My dear Friend
Where HAVE you been
To the station, of course
give us a hand, Pete
What on earth
It's nests
swallows' nests. We're going to dry them
in the oven and hang them up with string under the eaves of the
coach-house
Yes
and then we're going to save up all the wool and
hair we can get, and in the spring we'll line them, and then how pleased
the swallows will be
I've often thought people don't do nearly enough for dumb animals
I do think people might have thought
of making nests for poor little swallows before this
Oh
if everybody thought of everything, there'd
be nothing left for anybody else to think about
Look at the nests -- aren't they pretty
Look out, Phil, you goat
There now
Never mind
It IS one of my own
so you needn't jaw, Peter. Yes,
we've put our initial names on the ones we've done, so that the swallows
will know who they've got to be so grateful to and fond of
Swallows can't read, silly
Silly yourself
how do you know
Who thought of making the nests, anyhow
I did
Nya
you only thought of making hay ones and sticking
them in the ivy for the sparrows, and they'd have been sopping LONG
before egg-laying time. It was me said clay and swallows
I don't care what you said
Look
I've made the nest all right again. Give me the
bit of stick to mark your initial name on it. But how can you? Your
letter and Peter's are the same. P. for Peter, P. for Phyllis
I put F. for Phyllis
That's how
it sounds. The swallows wouldn't spell Phyllis with a P., I'm
certain-sure
They can't spell at all
Then why do you see them always on Christmas cards and valentines
with letters round their necks? How would they know where to go if they
couldn't read
That's only in pictures. You never saw one really with letters round
its neck
Well, I have a pigeon, then; at least Daddy told me they did. Only it
was under their wings and not round their necks, but it comes to the
same thing, and
I say
there's to be a paperchase to-morrow
Who
Grammar School. Perks thinks the hare will go along by the line at
first. We might go along the cutting. You can see a long way from
there
If we go to the cutting
we shall see the workmen, even
if we miss the paperchase
Let me
pass, please
That's against the by-laws
Why worry
live and let live's what I always
say. Ain't you never been young yourself, Mr. Bates
I ought to report him
Why spoil sport's what I always say
Passengers are forbidden to cross the line on any pretence
He ain't no passenger
Nor 'e ain't crossed the line, not where we could see 'im do it
Nor yet 'e ain't made no pretences
And
e's outer sight now. What the eye
don't see the 'art needn't take no notice of's what I always say
They don't know what they're in for
it isn't so
easy running in the dark. The tunnel takes two or three turns
They'll take a long time to get through, you think
An hour or more, I shouldn't wonder
Then let's cut across the top and see them come out at the other end
we shall get there long before they do
It's like Alps
Or Andes
It's like Himmy what's its names
Mount Everlasting.
Do let's stop
Stick to it
you'll get your second wind in a minute
Halt
Plenty of time
the rest's all down hill
Oh, look
What at
The view
I hate views
don't you, Peter
Let's get on
But this isn't like a view they take you to in carriages when you're
at the seaside, all sea and sand and bare hills. It's like the 'coloured
counties' in one of Mother's poetry books
It's not so dusty
look at the Aqueduct straddling slap
across the valley like a giant centipede, and then the towns sticking
their church spires up out of the trees like pens out of an inkstand.
_I_ think it's more like

     "There could he see the banners
      Of twelve fair cities shine
I love it
it's worth the climb
The paperchase is worth the climb
if we don't lose it.
Let's get on. It's all down hill now
_I_ said that ten minutes ago
Well, I'VE said it now
come on
Loads of time
They've gone long ago, of course
I don't think so
but even if they had, it's ripping
here, and we shall see the trains come out of the tunnel like dragons
out of lairs. We've never seen that from the top side before
No more we have
I KNOW the paperchase has gone long ago
Look out. Here he comes
There, now
what did I tell you? Now for the hounds
There
that's all -- now what shall we do
Go along into the tulgy wood over there and have lunch
we can see them for miles from up here
Not yet
That's not the last. There's the one in the red
jersey to come yet. Let's see the last of them come out
Oh, let's have lunch
I've got a pain in my front with
being so hungry. You must have missed seeing the red-jerseyed one when
he came out with the others
Let's get down to the tunnel mouth
then perhaps we shall
see him coming along from the inside. I expect he felt spun-chuck, and
rested in one of the manholes. You stay up here and watch, Bob, and when
I signal from below, you come down. We might miss seeing him on the way
down, with all these trees
Oh, do, DO let's have something to eat
I shall die
if you don't, and then you'll be sorry
Give her the sandwiches, for goodness' sake, and stop her silly mouth
Look here
perhaps we'd better have one each, too. We may need all our
strength. Not more than one, though. There's no time
What
Don't you see
that red-jerseyed hound
has had an accident -- that's what it is. Perhaps even as we speak he's
lying with his head on the metals, an unresisting prey to any passing
express
Oh, don't try to talk like a book
come on. Phil, keep close behind me, and if a train
comes, stand flat against the tunnel wall and hold your petticoats close
to you
Give me one more sandwich
and I will
I'm going first
it was my idea
I want to go back
I don't like it. It'll be pitch dark
in a minute. I WON'T go on in the dark. I don't care what you say, I
WON'T
Don't be a silly cuckoo
I've got a candle end and
matches, and -- what's that
It's a train
Which line
Let me go back
Don't be a coward
it's quite safe. Stand back
Come on
Quick! Manhole
It IS a dragon -- I always knew it was -- it takes its own shape in here,
in the dark
in case she should be frightened
OH
Come on
Oh
if the red-jerseyed one was in the way of the
train
We've got to go and see
Couldn't we go and send someone from the station
Would you rather wait here for us
Hullo
Was the red, blood? Is he all killed
Killed? Nonsense
There's nothing red about him except
his jersey. He's only fainted. What on earth are we to do
Can we move him
I don't know; he's a big chap
Suppose we bathe his forehead with water. No, I know we haven't any,
but milk's just as wet. There's a whole bottle
Yes
and they rub people's hands, I believe
They burn feathers, I know
What's the good of saying that when we haven't any feathers
As it happens
I've
got a shuttlecock in my pocket. So there
Oh, look up, speak to me! For my sake, speak
Oh, look up! Speak to me! For MY sake, speak
Wet his ears with milk
I know they do it to people that
faint -- with eau-de-Cologne. But I expect milk's just as good
Oh, DO look up
For MY sake! I believe he's dead
For MY sake
No, he isn't
For ANY sake
come out of it
Chuck it
Oh, he's NOT dead
I KNEW he wasn't
What's up? I'm all right
Drink this
What is it
It's milk
Fear not, you are in the hands of friends.
Phil, you stop bleating this minute
Do drink it
it'll do you good
Let him be a minute
he'll be all right as soon as
the milk begins to run like fire through his veins
I'm better now
I remember all about it
Bother! I believe I've broken
my leg
Did you tumble down
Of course not -- I'm not a kiddie
it was
one of those beastly wires tripped me up, and when I tried to get up
again I couldn't stand, so I sat down. Gee whillikins! it does hurt,
though. How did YOU get here
We saw you all go into the tunnel and then we went across the hill to
see you all come out. And the others did -- all but you, and you didn't.
So we are a rescue party
You've got some pluck, I will say
Oh, that's nothing
Do you think you could
walk if we helped you
I could try
Here, let me sit down. I feel like dying
Let go of
me -- let go, quick
What on earth
Look here
you must go and get help. Go to the
nearest house
Yes, that's the only thing
Come on
If you take his feet and Phil and I take his head, we could carry him
to the manhole
Now
I'll stay with him. You take the longest bit of
candle, and, oh -- be quick, for this bit won't burn long
I don't think Mother would like me leaving you
Let me stay, and you and Phil go
No, no
you and Phil go -- and lend me your knife. I'll
try to get his boot off before he wakes up again
I hope it's all right what we're doing
Of course it's right
What else WOULD you
do? Leave him here all alone because it's dark? Nonsense. Hurry up,
that's all
Don't be a silly little girl
clever
SILLY little girl
The poor leg
it ought to have a cushion -- ah
Oh, what useful things flannel petticoats are
the man who
invented them ought to have a statue directed to him
WHAT ought to be directed? Who to
Oh
now you're better! Hold your teeth and don't let it
hurt too much. Now
Don't faint again, PLEASE don't
Oh, that hurts
Oh -- no, it doesn't -- it's
nice, really
What's your name
Jim
Mine's Bobbie
But you're a girl, aren't you
Yes, my long name's Roberta
I say -- Bobbie
Yes
Wasn't there some more of you just now
Yes, Peter and Phil -- that's my brother and sister. They've gone to get
someone to carry you out
What rum names. All boys'
Yes -- I wish I was a boy, don't you
I think you're all right as you are
I didn't mean that -- I meant don't you wish YOU were a boy, but of
course you are without wishing
You're just as brave as a boy. Why didn't you go with the others
Somebody had to stay with you
Tell you what, Bobbie
you're a brick. Shake
I won't shake it
because it would shake YOU, and that
would shake your poor leg, and that would hurt. Have you got a hanky
I don't expect I have
Yes, I have. What for
That's jolly
what is it
Milk
We haven't any water
You're a jolly good little nurse
I do it for Mother sometimes
not milk, of course,
but scent, or vinegar and water. I say, I must put the candle out now,
because there mayn't be enough of the other one to get you out by
By George
you think of everything
I say, Bobbie
aren't you afraid
of the dark
Not -- not very, that is
Let's hold hands
pawings
You all right, Bobbie
I'm afraid it's hurting you most awfully, Jim. I AM so sorry
There's no end to this tunnel
Stick to it
everything has an end, and you get to it if
you only keep all on
Hurray
there's the end of the tunnel -- looks
just like a pin-hole in a bit of black paper, doesn't it
I'll never go into a tunnel again as long as ever I live
not if there are twenty hundred thousand millions hounds inside with
red jerseys and their legs broken
Don't be a silly cuckoo
You'd HAVE to
I think it was very brave and good of me
Not it
you didn't go because you were brave, but because
Bobbie and I aren't skunks. Now where's the nearest house, I wonder? You
can't see anything here for the trees
There's a roof over there
That's the signal-box
and you know you're not allowed to
speak to signalmen on duty. It's wrong
I'm not near so afraid of doing wrong as I was of going into that
tunnel
Come on
Hi
My hat
wake up
like a mad
maniac
Oh, my heavens -- what's o'clock
Twelve thirteen
like large dewdrops on a white
cabbage
with quite
extra-sized trembles
Thank God, thank God you come in
when you did -- oh, thank God
Oh, don't cry -- don't
it's all right now
I'm downright shamed, that I am
snivelling like a kid
And what was you doing up here, anyway
you know it ain't allowed
Yes
we knew it was wrong -- but I wasn't afraid of doing
wrong, and so it turned out right. You aren't sorry we came
Lor' love you -- if you hadn't 'a' come
It's a disgrace, so it is, sleeping on duty. If it was to come to be
known -- even as it is, when no harm's come of it
It won't come to be known
we aren't sneaks. All the
same, you oughtn't to sleep on duty -- it's dangerous
Tell me something I don't know
but I can't help it.
I know'd well enough just how it 'ud be. But I couldn't get off. They
couldn't get no one to take on my duty. I tell you I ain't had ten
minutes' sleep this last five days. My little chap's ill -- pewmonia, the
Doctor says -- and there's no one but me and 'is little sister to do for
him. That's where it is. The gell must 'ave her sleep. Dangerous? Yes, I
believe you. Now go and split on me if you like
Of course we won't
You asked us
to tell you something you don't know. Well,
I will. There's a boy in the tunnel over there with a red jersey and his
leg broken
What did he want to go into the blooming tunnel for, then
Don't you be so cross
WE haven't done anything
wrong except coming and waking you up, and that was right, as it
happens
Well
I don't see as I can do anything. I can't leave
the box
You might tell us where to go after someone who isn't in a box,
though
There's Brigden's farm over yonder -- where you see the smoke a-coming
up through the trees
Well, good-bye, then
Wait a minute
Here
I'll give you this to hold your tongues about what's
taken place to-day
You ARE a nasty man, though, aren't you
If anything COULD make me sneak, THAT would
Come, Phil
I forgive you
even if Peter doesn't. You're not in your
proper senses, or you'd never have done that. I know want of sleep sends
people mad. Mother told me. I hope your little boy will soon be better,
and
Come on, Phil
I give you my sacred honour-word we'll never tell anyone. Kiss and be
friends
I do believe I'm a bit off my head, Sissy
Now run along
home to Mother. I didn't mean to put you about -- there
Where does he live
In Northumberland
I'm at school at Maidbridge
I suppose I've got to get back
there, somehow
Seems to me the Doctor ought to have a look in first
Oh, bring him up to our house
It's only a little way by
the road. I'm sure Mother would say we ought to
Will your Ma like you bringing home strangers with broken legs
She took the poor Russian home herself
I know she'd say
we ought
All right
you ought to know what your Ma 'ud like.
I wouldn't take it upon me to fetch him up to our place without I asked
the Missus first, and they call me the Master, too
Are you sure your Mother won't mind
Certain
Then we're to take him up to Three Chimneys
Of course
Then my lad shall nip up to Doctor's on his bike, and tell him to come
down there. Now, lads, lift him quiet and steady. One, two, three
Oh, Mother
do come down. We found a hound in a red jersey
in the tunnel, and he's broken his leg and they're bringing him home
They ought to take him to the vet
I really CAN'T have a lame dog here
He's not a dog, really -- he's a boy
Then he ought to be taken home to his mother
His mother's dead
and his father's in Northumberland.
Oh, Mother, you will be nice to him? I told him I was sure you'd want us
to bring him home. You always want to help everybody
Oh, well
we must make the best of it
I am glad you brought him here. Now, Jim, let's get you comfortable in
bed before the Doctor comes
It'll hurt rather, won't it
I don't mean to be a coward.
You won't think I'm a coward if I faint again, will you? I really
and truly don't do it on purpose. And I do hate to give you all this
trouble
Don't you worry
it's you that have the trouble, you
poor dear -- not us
We love to have you
here -- don't we, Bobbie
Yes
bad was the best
It's horrible
Oh, I wish Dr. Forrest would make haste.
Oh, poor Jim
It IS horrible
but it's very exciting. I wish Doctors
weren't so stuck-up about who they'll have in the room when they're
doing things. I should most awfully like to see a leg set. I believe the
bones crunch like anything
Don't
Rubbish
How are you going to be Red Cross Nurses, like
you were talking of coming home, if you can't even stand hearing me say
about bones crunching? You'd have to HEAR them crunch on the field of
battle -- and be steeped in gore up to the elbows as likely as not, and
Stop it
you don't know how funny
you're making me feel
Me, too
Cowards
I'm not
I helped Mother with your rake-wounded foot,
and so did Phil -- you know we did
Well, then
Now look here. It would be a jolly good thing
for you if I were to talk to you every day for half an hour about broken
bones and people's insides, so as to get you used to it
Listen
that's the bone crunching
I do wish you wouldn't
Bobbie doesn't like it
I'll tell you what they do
I'll tell you what they do
they strap the broken man down so that he can't resist or
interfere with their doctorish designs, and then someone holds his head,
and someone holds his leg -- the broken one, and pulls it till the bones
fit in -- with a crunch, mind you! Then they strap it up and -- let's play
at bone-setting
Oh, no
All right -- LET'S! I'll be the doctor, and
Phil can be the nurse. You can be the broken boner; we can get at your
legs more easily, because you don't wear petticoats
I'll get the splints and bandages
you get the couch of
suffering ready
Now, then
Not so loud
You pull, Phil
Not so tight
You'll break my other leg
That's enough
I can't move at all. Oh, my poor leg
SURE you can't move
Quite sure
Shall we play it's bleeding freely or
not
YOU can play what you like
Phil and I are going away. And we shan't untie you till you promise
never, never to talk to us about blood and wounds unless we say you may.
Come, Phil
You beast
I'll never promise, never. I'll
yell, and Mother will come
Do
and tell her why we tied you up! Come on, Phil. No,
I'm not a beast, Peter. But you wouldn't stop when we asked you and
Yah
it wasn't even your own idea. You got it out of
Stalky
Well
THAT job's done. It's a nice clean fracture, and it'll
go on all right, I've no doubt. Plucky young chap, too -- hullo! what's
all this
Playing at prisoners, eh
Oh, no
not at PRISONERS. We were playing at setting
bones. Peter's the broken boner, and I was the doctor
Then I must say
that's it's
a very heartless game. Haven't you enough imagination even to faintly
picture what's been going on upstairs? That poor chap, with the drops
of sweat on his forehead, and biting his lips so as not to cry out, and
every touch on his leg agony and
YOU ought to be tied up
you're as bad as
Hush
I'm sorry, but we weren't heartless, really
I was, I suppose
All right, Bobbie, don't you
go on being noble and screening me, because I jolly well won't have it.
It was only that I kept on talking about blood and wounds. I wanted to
train them for Red Cross Nurses. And I wouldn't stop when they asked
me
Well
Well -- then I said, 'Let's play at setting bones.' It was all rot. I
knew Bobbie wouldn't. I only said it to tease her. And then when she
said 'yes,' of course I had to go through with it. And they tied me up.
They got it out of Stalky. And I think it's a beastly shame
I didn't think that anyone would know but us
I never thought of your coming in.
And hearing about blood and wounds does really make me feel most awfully
funny. It was only a joke our tying him up. Let me untie you, Pete
I don't care if you never untie me
and if that's your
idea of a joke
If I were you
I should be untied before your Mother comes down. You
don't want to worry her just now, do you
I don't promise anything about not saying about wounds, mind
I'm very sorry, Pete
but if you only knew how
sick you made me feel
You've made ME feel pretty sick, I can tell you
I looked in
to see if one of you would come along
to the surgery. There are some things that your Mother will want at
once, and I've given my man a day off to go and see the circus; will you
come, Peter
Let me carry your bag. I say, it is heavy -- what's in it
Oh, knives and lancets and different instruments for hurting people.
And the ether bottle. I had to give him ether, you know -- the agony was
so intense
Tell me all about how you found that chap
You'll excuse my shoving my oar in, won't you? But I should like to say
something to you
Now for a rowing
Something scientific
Yes
Well then, you see. Boys and girls are only little men and women. And
WE are much harder and hardier than they are
we
and much stronger, and things
that hurt THEM don't hurt US. You know you mustn't hit a girl
I should think not, indeed
Not even if she's your own sister. That's because girls are so much
softer and weaker than we are; they have to be, you know
because if they weren't, it wouldn't be nice for the babies. And that's
why all the animals are so good to the mother animals. They never fight
them, you know
I know
two buck rabbits will fight all day
if you let them, but they won't hurt a doe
No; and quite wild beasts -- lions and elephants -- they're immensely
gentle with the female beasts. And we've got to be, too
I see
And their hearts are soft, too
and things that
we shouldn't think anything of hurt them dreadfully. So that a man has
to be very careful, not only of his fists, but of his words. They're
awfully brave, you know
Think of Bobbie waiting alone in
the tunnel with that poor chap. It's an odd thing -- the softer and more
easily hurt a woman is the better she can screw herself up to do what
HAS to be done. I've seen some brave women -- your Mother's one
Yes
Well, that's all. Excuse my mentioning it. But nobody knows everything
without being told. And you see what I mean, don't you
Yes
I'm sorry. There
Of course you are! People always are -- directly they understand.
Everyone ought to be taught these scientific facts. So long
It's Pax
Dr.
Forrest has been talking scientific to me. No, it's no use my telling
you what he said; you wouldn't understand. But it all comes to you girls
being poor, soft, weak, frightened things like rabbits, so us men have
just got to put up with them. He said you were female beasts. Shall I
take this up to Mother, or will you
I know what BOYS are
they're just
the nastiest, rudest
They're very brave
sometimes
Ah, you mean the chap upstairs? I see. Go ahead, Phil -- I shall put
up with you whatever you say because you're a poor, weak, frightened,
soft
Not if I pull your hair you won't
Don't you see
he's
sorry, really, only he won't say so? Let's say we're sorry
It's so goody goody
he said we were female
beasts, and soft and frightened
Then let's show him we're not frightened of him thinking us goody
goody
and we're not any more beasts than he is
We're sorry we tied you up, Pete
I thought you would be
Well, so we are
Now let honour be satisfied on both
sides
I did call it Pax
Then let it BE Pax
Come on, Phil, let's get the tea.
Pete, you might lay the cloth
I say
Dr. Forrest didn't REALLY
say we were female beasts, did he
Yes
but I think he meant we men were wild
beasts, too
How funny of him
May I come in, Mother
Yes, dear
anything wrong
I was just writing to Jim's grandfather. He lives near here,
you know
Yes, you said so at tea. That's what I want to say. Must you write to
him, Mother? Couldn't we keep Jim, and not say anything to his people
till he's well? It would be such a surprise for them
Well, yes
I think it would
You see
of course the girls are all right and all
that -- I'm not saying anything against THEM. But I should like it if I
had another chap to talk to sometimes
Yes
I know it's dull for you, dear. But I can't
help it. Next year perhaps I can send you to school -- you'd like that,
wouldn't you
I do miss the other chaps, rather
but if Jim could
stay after his leg was well, we could have awful larks
I've no doubt of it
Well -- perhaps he could, but you
know, dear, we're not rich. I can't afford to get him everything he'll
want. And he must have a nurse
Can't you nurse him, Mother? You do nurse people so beautifully
That's a pretty compliment, Pete -- but I can't do nursing and my writing
as well. That's the worst of it
Then you MUST send the letter to his grandfather
Of course -- and to his schoolmaster, too. We telegraphed to them both,
but I must write as well. They'll be most dreadfully anxious
I say, Mother, why can't his grandfather pay for a nurse
That would be ripping. I expect the old boy's rolling in
money. Grandfathers in books always are
Well, this one isn't in a book
so we mustn't expect him
to roll much
I say
wouldn't it be jolly if we all WERE in
a book, and you were writing it? Then you could make all sorts of jolly
things happen, and make Jim's legs get well at once and be all right
to-morrow, and Father come home soon and
Do you miss your Father very much
Awfully
You see
you see, it's not only him BEING
Father, but now he's away there's no other man in the house but
me -- that's why I want Jim to stay so frightfully much. Wouldn't you like
to be writing that book with us all in it, Mother, and make Daddy come
home soon
Don't you think it's rather nice to think that we're in a book that
God's writing? If I were writing the book, I might make mistakes. But
God knows how to make the story end just right -- in the way that's best
for us
Do you really believe that, Mother
Yes
I do believe it -- almost always -- except when I'm so sad
that I can't believe anything. But even when I can't believe it, I know
it's true -- and I try to believe. You don't know how I try, Peter. Now
take the letters to the post, and don't let's be sad any more. Courage,
courage! That's the finest of all the virtues! I dare say Jim will be
here for two or three weeks yet
That'll be the Doctor
I'll go. Shut the kitchen
door -- you're not fit to be seen
Who can it possibly be
Perhaps
Dr. Forrest has been attacked by
highwaymen and left for dead, and this is the man he's telegraphed for
to take his place. Mrs. Viney said he had a local tenant to do his work
when he went for a holiday, didn't you, Mrs. Viney
I did so, my dear
He's fallen down in a fit, more likely
all human aid
despaired of. And this is his man come to break the news to Mother
Nonsense
Mother wouldn't have taken the man
up into Jim's bedroom. Why should she? Listen -- the door's opening. Now
they'll come down. I'll open the door a crack
It's not listening
nobody in their senses would talk secrets on the stairs. And
Mother can't have secrets to talk with Dr. Forrest's stable-man -- and you
said it was him
Bobbie
Jim's grandfather has come
wash your hands and faces and
then you can see him. He wants to see you
There now
fancy us not even thinking of that! Let's have
some hot water, Mrs. Viney. I'm as black as your hat
Well, I never did
How do you do
It's our own old gentleman
Oh, it's you
How do you do
This is Jim's grandfather, Mr
How splendid
that's just exactly like a book, isn't it,
Mother
It is, rather
things do happen in real life
that are rather like books, sometimes
I am so awfully glad it IS you
when you think of the
tons of old gentlemen there are in the world -- it might have been almost
anyone
I say, though
you're not going to take Jim away, though,
are you
Not at present
Your Mother has most kindly
consented to let him stay here. I thought of sending a nurse, but your
Mother is good enough to say that she will nurse him herself
But what about her writing
There won't be anything for him to eat if Mother doesn't write
That's all right
I see
you trust your children, and confide in them
Of course
Then I may tell them of our little arrangement
Your Mother,
my dears, has consented to give up writing for a little while and to
become a Matron of my Hospital
Oh
and shall we have to go away from Three
Chimneys and the Railway and everything
No, no, darling
The Hospital is called Three Chimneys Hospital
and my unlucky Jim's the only patient, and I hope he'll
continue to be so. Your Mother will be Matron, and there'll be a
hospital staff of a housemaid and a cook -- till Jim's well
And then will Mother go on writing again
We shall see
perhaps something nice may happen and she won't have to
I love my writing
I know
don't be afraid that I'm going to try
to interfere. But one never knows. Very wonderful and beautiful things
do happen, don't they? And we live most of our lives in the hope of
them. I may come again to see the boy
Surely
and I don't know how to thank you for making it
possible for me to nurse him. Dear boy
He kept calling Mother, Mother, in the night
I woke up
twice and heard him
He didn't mean me
that's why I wanted so much to keep him
I'm so glad
that you're going to keep him, Mother
Take care of your Mother, my dears
She's a
woman in a million
Yes, isn't she
God bless her
God bless her! Ay, and she shall be blessed. Dear me, where's my hat?
Will Bobbie come with me to the gate
You're a good child, my dear -- I got your letter. But it wasn't needed.
When I read about your Father's case in the papers at the time, I had my
doubts. And ever since I've known who you were, I've been trying to find
out things. I haven't done very much yet. But I have hopes, my dear -- I
have hopes
Oh
Yes -- I may say great hopes. But keep your secret a little longer.
Wouldn't do to upset your Mother with a false hope, would it
Oh, but it isn't false
I KNOW you can do it. I knew you
could when I wrote. It isn't a false hope, is it
No
I don't think it's a false hope, or I wouldn't have told
you. And I think you deserve to be told that there IS a hope
And you don't think Father did it, do you? Oh, say you don't think he
did
My dear
I'm perfectly CERTAIN he didn't
It's no good
if we can't think of
anything to amuse him, we just can't, and there's an end of it. Perhaps
something will just happen of its own accord that he'll like
Things DO happen by themselves sometimes, without your making them
I wish something would happen
something
wonderful
I wonder if the Railway misses us
We never go
to see it now
It seems ungrateful
we loved it so when we hadn't
anyone else to play with
Perks is always coming up to ask after Jim
and the
signalman's little boy is better. He told me so
I didn't mean the people
I meant the dear Railway
itself
The thing I don't like
is our having stopped waving to the 9.15 and sending our love
to Father by it
Let's begin again
Hurry up
or we shall miss the 9.15
I can't hurry more than I am doing
Oh, bother it! My
bootlace has come undone AGAIN
When you're married
your bootlace will come undone going
up the church aisle, and your man that you're going to get married to
will tumble over it and smash his nose in on the ornamented pavement;
and then you'll say you won't marry him, and you'll have to be an old
maid
I shan't
I'd much rather marry a man with his nose
smashed in than not marry anybody
It would be horrid to marry a man with a smashed nose, all the same
He wouldn't be able to smell the flowers at the
wedding. Wouldn't that be awful
Bother the flowers at the wedding
Look! the signal's
down. We must run
Take our love to Father
Take our love to Father
Well
WELL
_WELL
Whatever on earth does that mean
_I_ don't know
Perhaps the old gentleman told the
people at his station to look out for us and wave. He knew we should
like it
It is most extraordinarily rum
Most stronery
Don't you think the old gentleman's waves seemed more
significating than usual
No
I do
I thought he was trying to explain something to us
with his newspaper
Explain what
_I_ don't know
but I do feel most awfully funny. I
feel just exactly as if something was going to happen
What is going to happen
is that Phyllis's stocking is
going to come down
Don't you feel quite well, dear
I don't know
I don't know how
I feel. It isn't that I'm lazy. Mother, will you let me off lessons
to-day? I feel as if I wanted to be quite alone by myself
Yes, of course I'll let you off
but
What is it, my sweetheart
You don't feel ill, do you
I DON'T know
but I want to
be by myself and see if my head really IS all silly and my inside all
squirmy-twisty
Hadn't you better lie down
I'd be more alive in the garden, I think
I'll go down to the station
and talk to Perks and ask
about the signalman's little boy
God bless you, love
run along -- do
Morning, Miss, I'm sure
Good morning to you, Missie, and many of them! I wish you joy, that I
do
Oh
something IS going to happen! I know it is -- everyone is so odd, like
people are in dreams
The 11.54's a bit late, Miss -- the extra luggage this holiday time
Dear me
how very kind everybody
is to-day -- even you, Pussy
Hullo
ere you are. Well, if THIS is the train, it'll be
smart work! Well, God bless you, my dear! I see it in the paper, and
I don't think I was ever so glad of anything in all my born days
One I must have, Miss, and no
offence, I know, on a day like this 'ere
You ain't offended, are you
I ain't took too
great a liberty? On a day like this, you know
No, no
of course it's not a liberty, dear Mr. Perks;
we love you quite as much as if you were an uncle of ours -- but -- on a day
like WHAT
Like this 'ere
Don't I tell you I see it in the paper
Saw WHAT in the paper
Oh! my Daddy, my Daddy
I knew something wonderful was going to happen
but I didn't think it was going to be this. Oh, my
Daddy, my Daddy
Then didn't Mother get my letter
There weren't any letters this morning. Oh! Daddy! it IS really you,
isn't it
You
must go in by yourself, Bobbie, and tell Mother quite quietly that it's
all right. They've caught the man who did it. Everyone knows now that it
wasn't your Daddy
_I_ always knew it wasn't
Me and Mother and our old
gentleman
Yes
it's all his doing. Mother wrote and told me you had
found out. And she told me what you'd been to her. My own little girl
Come in, Daddy; come in
