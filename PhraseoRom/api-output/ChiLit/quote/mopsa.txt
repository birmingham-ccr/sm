Look at those five grand ones with high prows: they were part of the
Spanish Armada
And can this be my own world?
    'Tis all gold and snow,
  Save where scarlet waves are hurled
    Down yon gulf below
'Tis thy world, 'tis my world,
    City, mead, and shore,
  For he that hath his own world
    Hath many worlds more
Jack! Jack
I must get in
here
I wish this hole was larger
Those heads had no beaks, I am sure
And the things have no
feathers
O don't, Jack
It's a fairy
How curious! and this must
be a fairy's nest. Oh, how angry the old mother will be if this little
thing creeps away and gets out of the hole
Oh,
the hole is on the other side
Well
I may have to stay inside here for a long time,
and I have nothing to eat but this cake; however, your mouths are very
small, so you shall have a piece
I am sure it cannot be night yet
Look at that
what is to be done now? the hole is so far
off that it's night up there, and down here I haven't done eating my
lunch
Well
then why don't you whistle
When first I saw you in the nest
you had a pinafore on,
and now you have a smart little apron, with lace round it
That is because I am much older now
we never take
such a long time to grow up as you do
But your pinafore
Turned into an apron, of course
just as your
velvet jacket will turn into a tail-coat when you are old enough
It won't
Yes it will
Don't argue with me; I am older now than you are,-- nearly grown up,
in fact. Put me into your pocket again, and whistle as loudly as you
can
Worse and worse
why, this was a boy fairy, and now he has a mustache and a
sword, and looks as fierce as possible
I think I heard my sister tell you to whistle
Yes, she did
Well, I suppose I had better do it
Why did you leave off so soon
Why, if you wish to know
it was because I thought
something took hold of my legs
Ridiculous child
how do you think you
are ever to get out, if she doesn't take hold of your legs
I should be more comfortable
if I knew how I could
get home again. I don't wish to go home just yet, for I want to see
where we are flying to, but papa and mamma will be frightened if I
never do
Oh no
you need
not be at all afraid about that. When boys go to Fairyland, their
parents never are uneasy about them
Really
Quite true
And so we are going to Fairyland
how delightful
Yes
the back way, mind; we are only going the
back way. You could go in two minutes by the usual route; but these
young fairies want to go before they are summoned, and therefore you
and I are taking them
They seem to be all fast asleep
Perhaps they will sleep till we come to the wonderful river
What craft is this that hangs out no light
I might ask the same question of you
I'm only a poor Will-o'-the-wisp
and you know
very well that I have but a lantern to show
I hope I have not hurt you, William
I will
light up immediately. Good-night
Good-night
They snore
they are very fast asleep, and
before they wake I should like to talk to you a little
My name
is Jenny. Do you think you shall
remember that? because, when you are in Fairyland and want some one to
take you home again, and call 'Jenny,' I shall be able to come to you;
and I shall come with pleasure, for I like boys better than fairies
Thank you
Oh yes, I shall remember your name, it is
such a very easy one
If it is in the night that you want me, just look up
and you will see a green and a red spark moving in the
air; you will then call Jenny, and I will come; but remember that I
cannot come unless you do call me
Very well
Why, those are clouds
and O how rosy they have all
turned! I thought they were mountains
Yes, they are clouds
It has been our lot to sail with many captains, not one
  of whom is fit to be a patch on your back
Are those young fairies awake yet
As sound asleep as ever
but, Albatross, is not that
the sea which lies under us? You are a sea-bird, I know, but I am not
a sea boy, and I cannot live in the water
Yes, that is the sea
Don't you observe
that it is covered with ships
I see boats and vessels
and all their sails are
set, but they cannot sail, because there is no wind
The wind never does blow in this great bay
and
those ships would all lie there becalmed till they dropped to pieces
if one of them was not wanted now and then to go up the wonderful
river
But how did they come there
Some of them had captains who ill-used their cabin-boys, some were
pirate ships, and others were going out on evil errands. The
consequence was, that when they chanced to sail within this great bay
they got becalmed; the fairies came and picked all the sailors out and
threw them into the water; they then took away the flags and pennons
to make their best coats of, threw the ship-biscuits and other
provisions to the fishes, and set all the sails. Many ships which are
supposed by men to have foundered lie becalmed in this quiet sea. Look
at those five grand ones with high prows; they are moored close
together; they were part of the Spanish Armada: and those open boats
with blue sails belonged to the Romans; they sailed with Caesar when he
invaded Britain
It must not be a large one
for the river in some places
is very shallow
You remember my name
Oh yes
That's well
then, in the next place, are those
fairies awake yet
No, they are not
They are certainly asleep
Put them away again, and
take great care of them. Mind you don't lose any of them, for I really
don't know what will happen if you do. Now I have one thing more to
say to you, and that is, are you hungry
Rather
Then
as soon as you feel _very_ hungry, lie
down in the bottom of the boat and go to sleep. You will dream that
you see before you a roasted fowl, some new potatoes, and an
apple-pie. Mind you don't eat too much in your dream, or you will be
sorry for it when you wake. That is all. Good-by! I must go
Boat ahoy
Tell that boat of yours to mind what she is about
Yes, sir
You ought to be ashamed of yourself, running down these little
live fishing-vessels so carelessly. Go at a more gentle pace
Now that bird told me not to eat too much
and yet I
have done it. I never felt so full in my life
Wake, baillie, wake! the crafts are out;
    Wake
be quick!
  For high street, bye street, over the town
    They fight with poker and stick
A fight so fell was ne'er
    In all thy bailliewick
Tick, tick, tick
Wake, daughter, wake! the hour draws on;
    Wake
be quick!
  The meats are set, the guests are coming,
    The fiddler waxing his stick
The bridegroom waiting and waiting
    To see thy face is sick
Tick, tick, tick
Oh
how I wish my boat would swim into that bay and let me land
How odd
I wonder whether I ought to have spoken; for
the boat certainly did not intend to come into this bay. However, I
think I will let her alone now, for I certainly do wish very much to
land here
Will
you be so kind as to tell me whether this is Fairyland
What does he say
I asked if this was Fairyland
He says, 'Is this Fairyland
Oh, does he
I shall leave off now; I've got a
pain in my works
Do
We'll go home and have a cup of tea
Can you
strike
I can if I choose
I have a great mind to land
I should not wonder at
all if this is Fairyland. So as the boat came here to please me, I
shall ask it to stay where it is, in case I should want it again
Stay just where you are,
will you
Is there any law to prevent my coming into your country
Wo
Any law? No, not that I know of; but if
you are a stranger here you had better look out
Why
You don't suppose, do you
that our Queen will wind
up strangers
I shouldn't wonder if he goes eight days. Gee
No, wo
No, no. Gee! I tell you
Now, then, which is it to be? I'm willing to gee, and I'm agreeable
to wo; but what's a fellow to do when you say them both together
Why, he talks
It's because he's got a cold in his head
he always talks when he's got a cold, and there's no
pleasing him; whatever you say, he's not satisfied. Gee, Boney, do
Gee it is, then
He spoke again
It appears that your horses don't talk
Never
they can't
You mean they won't
You'll find out some day,
perhaps
whether horses can talk or not
Shall I
They'll TELL
I wouldn't be you when
they tell how you've used them
Have you been ill used
Yes, yes, of course he has
but he has
come here to get all right again. This is a very wholesome country for
horses; isn't it, Boney
Yes
Well, then, jog on, there's a dear
Why,
you will be young again soon, you know,-- young, and gamesome, and
handsome; you'll be quite a colt, by and by, and then we shall set you
free to join your companions in the happy meadows
He was shamefully used
Look at him,
how lean he is! You can see all his ribs
Yes
He
gets low-spirited when he thinks of all he has gone through; but he is
a vast deal better already than he was. He used to live in London; his
master always carried a long whip to beat him with, and never spoke
civilly to him
London
why that is in my country. How did the
horse get here
That's no business of yours
But I can
tell you he came because he was wanted, which is more than you are
You let him alone
I don't
bear any malice
No; he has a good disposition, has Boney
Pray, are you a boy
Yes
A real boy, that wants no winding up
I don't know what you mean
but I am a real boy,
certainly
Ah
Well, I thought you were, by the way Boney spoke
to you. How frightened you must be! I wonder what will be done to all
your people for driving, and working, and beating so many beautiful
creatures to death every year that comes? They'll have to pay for it
some day, you may depend
They worked him, and often drove him about all night in the miserable
streets, and never let him have so much as a canter in a green field
but he'll be all right now, only he has to
begin at the wrong end
What do you mean
Why, in this country
they begin by being
terribly old and stiff, and they seem miserable and jaded at first,
but by degrees they get young again, as you heard me reminding him
Indeed
and do you like that
It has nothing to do with me
We are only here to
take care of all the creatures that men have ill used. While they are
sick and old, which they are when first they come to us,-- after they
are dead, you know,-- we take care of them, and gradually bring them up
to be young and happy again
This must be a very nice country to live in, then
For horses it is
Well
it does seem very full of haystacks, certainly,
and all the air smells of fresh grass
Faxa, I think I
could fancy a handful of clover
You shouldn't be in such a hurry
your
weights will be running down some day, if you don't mind
It's all zeal
Oh, here you are, Dow
Come along, will you? Lady Betty wants you; it's such a hot day, and
nobody, she says, can fan her so well as you can
Oh, this must be Fairyland, I am sure
for in my
country our pulses beat quite differently from that
Well
do you find any fault with the way
I go
No
I think you
walk beautifully; your steps are so regular
She's machine-made
In the largest magnifying-glass you'll hardly
find the least fault with her chain. She's not like the goods they
turn out in Clerkenwell
I'm so glad you are come, my good Dow
Don't
you think I am strong enough to-day to set off for the happy
meadows
Well
I'm afraid not yet; you must remember that it is of
no use your leaving us till you have quite got over the effects of the
fall
Take that boy away; he
reminds me of a jockey
You young rascal
How you do
run! It's enough to break your mainspring
What harm did I do
I was only looking at the mare
Harm
harm indeed! Why, you reminded her of a
jockey. It's enough to hold her back, poor thing!-- and we trying so
hard, too, to make her forget what a cruel end she came to in the old
world
You need not hold me so tightly
I shall not run away
again; but
if this is Fairyland, it is not half such a
nice country as I expected
Fairyland
Why,
what made you think of such a thing? This is only one of the border
countries, where things are set right again that people have caused to
go wrong in the world. The world, you know, is what men and women call
their own home
I know
and that's where I came from
And I wish you would
tell me about Lady Betty
She was a beautiful fleet creature, of the racehorse breed
and she won silver cups for her master, and then they made her
run a steeple-chase, which frightened her, but still she won it; and
then they made her run another, and she cleared some terribly high
hurdles, and many gates and ditches, till she came to an awful one,
and at first she would not take it, but her rider spurred and beat her
till she tried. It was beyond her powers, and she fell and broke both
her forelegs. Then they shot her. After she had died that miserable
death, we had her here, to make her all right again
Is this the only country where you set things right
Certainly not
they lie about in all
directions. Why, you might wander for years, and never come to the end
of this one
I am afraid I shall not find the one I am looking for
if your countries are so large
I don't think our world is much larger than yours
But come along: I hear the bell, and we are a good way from
the palace
What is that woman doing
Winding us up, to be sure
You don't suppose,
surely, that we can go forever
Extraordinary
Then are you wound up every evening, like
watches
Unless we have misbehaved ourselves
and then she
lets us run down
And what then
What then
why, then we have to stop and stand
against a wall, till she is pleased to forgive us, and let our friends
carry us in to be set going again
You must take your turn with the others
There's no key-hole in my head
besides, I do not want
any woman to wind me up
But you must do as others do
and if you have no
key-hole, our Queen can easily have one made, I should think
Make one in my head
She shall do no such thing
We shall see
Buzz
There is no meat
so tender; I wish I could pick their little eyes out
Yes
fairies are delicate eating indeed. We must
speak Jack fair if we want to get at them
No
No more am I
not at all hungry
And how are the sweet fairies that my young master is taking to their
home
I hope they are safe in my young
master's pockets
Eh
did this dear young
gentleman say that the fairies were asleep
It doesn't amuse me to talk about fairies
but if you
would explain some of the things in this country that I cannot make
out, I should be very glad
What things
Why
I see a full moon lying down there among the
water-flags, and just going to set, and there is a half-moon overhead
plunging among those great gray clouds, and just this moment I saw a
thin crescent moon peeping out between the branches of that tree
Well
did the young master never see a
crescent moon in the men and women's world
Oh yes
Did he never see a full moon
Yes, of course
but they are the same moon. I could
never see all three of them at the same time
If my young master did not see the moons it must have been because he
didn't look. Perhaps my young master slept in a room, and had only one
window; if so, he couldn't see all the sky at once
I tell you, Raven
that I KNOW there is never
more than one moon in my country, and sometimes there is no moon at
all
Raven
there's something very cold and slippery lying
at the bottom of the boat. I touched it just now, and I don't like it
at all
It's a water-snake
The water swarms with them, wicked, murderous creatures; they smell
the young fairies, and they want to eat them
You'll catch
it for this, my young master
I wish I might land
among those lovely glades on the left bank
Stay where you are
What'll you buy? what'll you buy, sir
Why, you've given me back my money
I do not like it
it's dirty; at least, it's not new
No, it's not new
but it is a
good sixpence
The bees don't like it
They like
things to be neat and new, and that sixpence is bent
What shall I give you then
This young gentleman has a
beautiful whistle round his neck
Thank you for the bees
They love to be called home when
we've collected flowers for them
What do you make such a fuss for
You've set your cage swinging with knocking yourself about; and what
good does that do? I cannot break the spell and open it for you
I know that
but it hurts my feelings
so that you should take no notice of me now that I have come down in
the world
Yes
it hurts our feelings
I haven't forgotten you
I was buying a measure of maize for you when you began to make such a
noise
I would much rather you would buy me a pocket-handkerchief. Here we
are, shut up, without a chance of getting out, and with nobody to pity
us; and we can't even have the comfort of crying, because we've got
nothing to wipe our eyes with
But at least
you CAN cry now if you please, and
when you had your other face you could not
Buy me a handkerchief
I can't afford both
and I've paid now for
the maize
It's a BOY, if ever there was one
Yes
I'm a boy
You won't go yet, will you
No, don't
I had no notion you were a boy till you touched my cage
Indeed
I'm a fairy
We are
imprisoned here by our enemies the gypsies
So we are
I'm sorry for that
I'm friends with the fairies
Don't tell
Here, neighbor
I must say good-by now, for the gypsy is
coming this way, and I want to buy some of her goods
Well, thank you
but I could
have wished it had been a pocket-handkerchief
I'll lend you my handkerchief
Here
It makes me tremble all over
to think of such good
luck
I say
I know all about it now. You've
got some of my people in your pockets,-- not of my own tribe, but
fairies
That gypsy woman who is coming with her cart
is a
fairy too, and very malicious. It was she and others of her tribe who
caught us and put us into these cages, for they are more powerful than
we. Mind you do not let her allure you into the woods, nor wheedle you
or frighten you into giving her any of those fairies
No
I will not
She sold us to the brown people
Mind you do
not buy anything of her, for your money in her palm would act as a
charm against you
She has a baby
Yes, a baby
and I hope by means of that
baby to get her driven away, and perhaps get free myself. I shall try
to put her in a passion. Here she comes
Buy, buy brushes,
        Baskets wrought o' rushes.
        Buy them, buy them, take them, try them,
              Buy, dames all
Buy, buy laces,
        Veils to screen your faces.
        Buy them, buy them, take and try them.
              Buy, maids, buy
What will you please to
buy, my pretty gentleman
That's to clear my throat
I love not you,
        John, John Brady
Pray now, pray now, go your way now,
        Do, John, do
Mate! mate! hand up my handkerchief. Oh! oh! it's so affecting, this
song is
How delightful it is to be
swung
John, John Brady
Do now, do now, once more woo now,
        Pray, John, pray
It's beautiful
and so ap-pro-pri-ate
Oh, you cruel, cruel woman
We will
have none of your goods, you false woman! Give us back our money, or
we will drive you out of the fair. You've stuck a stick into a turnip,
and dressed it up in baby clothes. You're a cheat! a cheat
My sweet gentlemen, my kind ladies
I like shawls; they're so becoming
If Jack lets her allure him into the woods, he'll never come out
again. She'll hang him up in a cage, as she did us. I say, how does
my shawl fit
You look charming, my dear; it fits well
A word in your ear; 'Share and share alike' is a fine
motto
What do you mean by all this
Jack
do they ever eat handkerchiefs in your part
of the country
No, never
Hold your tongue and be reasonable
What
do you want? I'll do it, whatever it is
But do they never pick out the marks
O
Jack! are you sure they never pick out the marks
The marks
Yes, perhaps they do
Stop
Oh! you're hurting me. What do you want? I say again, tell
me what you want, and you shall have it
We want to get out
you must undo the spell
Then give me my handkerchief
to bandage my
eyes. I dare not say the words with my eyes open. You had no business
to steal it. It was woven by human hands, so that nobody can see
through it; and if you don't give it to me, you'll never get out,-- no,
never
Then
you may have
Jack's handkerchief; it will bandage your eyes just as well. It was
woven over the water, as yours was
It won't do
give me my own
I tell you
that you shall have Jack's
handkerchief; you can do no harm with that
Well, pass out Jack's handkerchief. I will set you free if you will
bring out mine with you
Share and share alike
you must let all my
friends out too
Then I won't let you out
You shall come out
first, and give me my handkerchief, or not one of their cages will I
undo. So take your choice
My friends, then
Pull
Go on! go on
I shall pull her head off
No matter
no matter,-- only pull
There's a brave boy
Give me my handkerchief
It's in the cage, gypsy
you can get it yourself.
Say your words again
No, no, no
too late! Hide me! O good people, hide
me
What are they going to do to the poor
gypsy
Make her take her other form
and then she cannot hurt
us while she stays in our country. She is a fairy, as we have just
found out, and all fairies have two forms
Oh
They have pecked her so that she can hardly rise
Set me on your shoulder, Jack, and let me see the end
of it
That's right
She won't find much of herself here
It will not be very easy to put herself together again
My relations have put some of
our favorite food on board for you
This has been a most extraordinary day
the strangest
day I have had yet
Master
Where will ye go
Over moss, over muir.
    To court my new jo
Master, though the night be merk,
    I'se follow through the snow.

  "Court her, master, court her,
    So shall ye do weel;
  But and ben she'll guide the house,
    I'se get milk and meal.
  Ye'se get lilting while she sits
    With her rock and reel
For, oh! she has a sweet tongue,
    And een that look down,
  A gold girdle for her waist,
    And a purple gown.
  She has a good word forbye
    Fra a' folk in the town
It will be time enough to ask for them when you have had your
breakfast
Sit down. Welcome to our town. How do you like
it
She had a pair of spectacles on, and she was knitting
I should like it very much indeed
if there was anybody
in it
I'm glad of that
You've seen a good deal of it;
but it pleases me to find that you are a very honest boy. You did not
take anything at all. I am honest too
Yes
of course you are
And as I am pleased with you for being honest
I shall give you some breakfast out of my basket
Thank you
but I am not a beggar-boy; I have got a
half-crown, a shilling, a sixpence, and two pence; so I can buy this
breakfast of you, if you like. You look very poor
Do I
I wonder what has become of my stockings
You will never see them any more
I threw them
into the river, and they floated away
Why did you
Is that like the pair you lost
Oh no
these are much more beautiful stockings than
mine
Do you like them as well
I like them much better
How clever you
are
Would you like to wear these
instead of yours
I shouldn't like to wear them if you think I had better not
Well
I am very honest, as I told you; and therefore
I am obliged to say that if I were you I would not wear those
stockings on any account
Why not
Why not
why, because when you have those
stockings on, your feet belong to me
Oh
Well, if you think that matters, I'll take them off
again. Do you think it matters
Yes
it matters, because I am a slave, and my
master can make me do whatever he pleases, for I am completely in his
power. So, if he found out that I had knitted these stockings for you,
he would make me order you to walk into his mill,-- the mill which
grinds the corn for the town; and there you would have to grind and
grind till I got free again
If my fairies that I have in my pocket would only wake
I would fight your master; for if he is no bigger than you are,
perhaps I could beat him, and get you away
No, Jack
that would be of no use. The only
thing you could do would be to buy me; for my cruel master has said
that if ever I am late again he shall sell me in the slave market to
the brown people, who work underground. And, though I am dreadfully
afraid of my master, I mean to be late to-day, in hopes (as you are
kind, and as you have some money) that you will come to the
slave-market and buy me. Can you buy me, Jack, to be your slave
I don't want a slave
and, besides, I have hardly any
money to buy you with
But it is real money
not like what my master
has. His money has to be made every week, for if there comes a hot
day it cracks, so it never has time to look old, as your half-crown
does; and that is how we know the real money, for we cannot imitate
anything that is old. Oh, now, now it is twelve o'clock! now I am late
again! and though I said I would do it, I am so frightened
How am I to find your master
O Jack, buy me! buy me
You will find me in
the slave-market. Bid high for me. Go back and put your boots on, and
bid high
What I want
to buy now is a slave
Master, set your handsome feet on my back, that they
may be out of the dust
Don't be afraid of him
he won't gnaw your
feet. He knows well enough that they are real ones
Are the other people's feet not real
Of course not
They had a feud long ago with the
fairies, and they all went one night into a great corn-field which
belonged to these enemies of theirs, intending to steal the corn. So
they made themselves invisible, as they are always obliged to do till
twelve o'clock at noon; but before morning dawn, the wheat being quite
ripe, down came the fairies with their sickles, surrounded the field,
and cut the corn. So all their legs of course got cut off with it, for
when they are invisible they cannot stir. Ever since that they have
been obliged to make their legs of wood
Good-day
So you have sold that good-for-nothing slave of
yours
Yes
She was late again this
morning, and came to me crying and praying to be forgiven; but I was
determined to make an example of her, so I sold her at once to
Clink-of-the-Hole, and he has just driven her away to work in his
mine
If you
will guide me to Clink's hole, you shall be my dog
Master, I will do my best
Good-day, sir
You are a stranger here, no
doubt
Yes
I only arrived this morning
Have you seen the town
there is a very fine
market
Yes, I have seen the market
I went into it to buy a
slave, but I did not see one that I liked
Ah
and yet they had some very fine articles
Now that's a useful body
enough, and I had her very cheap
What did you give for her
Three pitchers
and fifteen cups and saucers, and two
shillings in the money of the town
Is their money like this
Where did you get that, dear sir
Oh, it was given me
Oh, a shilling and a
penny,-- a shilling and a penny of mortal coin! What would I not give
for a shilling and a penny
I don't believe you have got anything to give
I see nothing but that ring on your finger, and the old woman
But I have a great many things at home, sir
and besides, that ring would be cheap at a
shilling,-- even a shilling of mortal coin
Would the slave be cheap at a penny
Would you give a penny for her, dear sir
She is honest
ask her whether I had better buy her
with this penny
It does not matter what she says
I would
sell twenty such as she is for a penny,-- a real one
Ask her
No
Why not
I'll make you suffer for this
Shall I buy you with this, slave
Speak
and if you don't say 'Yes,' I'll
strike you
He cannot buy me with that
unless it is
the most valuable coin he has got
Stop
Can I buy you with this
Yes
Shall she be my slave forever, and not yours
if I give
you this
She shall
Slave
that is a very ragged old apron that you have
got, and your gown is quite worn out. Don't you think we had better
spend my shilling in buying you some new clothes? You look so very
shabby
Do I
Well, master, you will do as
you please
But you know better than I do
though you are my
slave
You had better give me the shilling, then
and then I advise you to go back to the boat, and wait there
till I come
What
can you go all the way back into the town again? I
think you must be tired, for you know you are so very old
Why, you have not bought any new clothes
No, master
but I have bought what I
wanted
What do you mean by being
so silly? I can't scold you properly, because I don't know what name
to call you by, and I don't like to say 'Slave,' because that sounds
so rude. Why, this bit of ribbon is such a little bit that it's of no
use at all. It's not large enough even to make one mitten of
Isn't it
Just take hold of it, master, and let us
see if it will stretch
This is very good fun
why now it is as large as an apron
These are fairies
but what are you
That will do
Master, do you know what you have done?
look at me now
Madam, I am your most humble servant
I hope your Grace is well
These are fairies
but what are you
Jack kissed me
and I want to sit on his
knee
Yes
I took them out, and laid them in a row, to see
that they were safe, and this one I kissed, because she looked such a
little dear
Was she not like the others, then
Yes
but I liked her the best; she was my favorite
How comes it that you are not like your
companions
It's because Jack kissed
me
Even so it must be
the love of a mortal works
changes indeed. It is not often that we win anything so precious.
Here, master, let her sit on your knee sometimes, and take care of
her, for she cannot now take the same care of herself that others of
her race are capable of
Master, it is a long time
since you spoke to me
And yet
there is something that I particularly want to
ask you about
Ask it then
I don't like to have a slave
and as you are so
clever, don't you think you can find out how to be free again
I am very glad you asked me about that
Yes,
master, I wish very much to be free; and as you were so kind as to
give the most valuable piece of real money you possessed in order to
buy me, I can be free if you can think of anything that you really
like better than that half-crown, and if I can give it you
Oh, there are many things
I like going up this river
to Fairyland much better
But you are going there, master
you were on
the way before I met with you
I like this little child better
I love this little
Mopsa. I should like her to belong to me
She is yours
she belongs to you already.
Think of something else
Master, do you see those purple
mountains
At the other side of those mountains is Fairyland
but if you cannot think of something that you should like better to
have than your half-crown, I can never enter in. The river flows
straight up to yonder steep precipice, and there is a chasm in it
which pierces it, and through which the river runs down beneath, among
the very roots of the mountains, till it comes out at the other side.
Thousands and thousands of the small people will come when they see
the boat, each with a silken thread in his hand; but if there is a
slave in it, not all their strength and skill can tow it through. Look
at those rafts on the river; on them are the small people coming up
All these sailors to tow my slave
I wonder, I do
wonder, what you are
I have thought of something that I should like much better than
my half-crown. I should like to have a little tiny bit of that purple
gown of yours with the gold border
I thank you, master. Now I can be free
Now mind
I advise you never to stretch this unless you want to make
some particular thing of it, for then it will only stretch to the
right size; but if you merely begin to pull it for your own amusement,
it will go on stretching and stretching, and I don't know where it
will stop
Jack,
there is no one listening now, so I will tell you my story. I am the
Fairy Queen
One day, long, long ago
I was discontented with my
own happy country. I wished to see the world, so I set forth with a
number of the one-foot-one fairies, and went down the wonderful river,
thinking to see the world.

"So we sailed down the river till we came to that town which you know
of; and there, in the very middle of the stream, stood a tower,-- a
tall tower, built upon a rock.

"Fairies are afraid of nothing but of other fairies, and we did not
think this tower was fairy-work, so we left our ship and went up the
rock and into the tower, to see what it was like; but just as we had
descended into the dungeon keep, we heard the gurgling of water
overhead, and down came the tower. It was nothing but water enchanted
into the likeness of stone, and we all fell down with it into the very
bed of the river.

"Of course we were not drowned, but there we were obliged to lie, for
we have no power out of our own element; and the next day the
towns-people came down with a net and dragged the river, picked us all
out of the meshes, and made us slaves. The one-foot-one fairies got
away shortly; but from that day to this, in sorrow and distress, I
have had to serve my masters. Luckily, my crown had fallen off in the
water, so I was not known to be the Queen; but till you came, Jack, I
had almost forgotten that I had ever been happy and free, and I had
hardly any hope of getting away
How sorry your people must have been
when they found
you did not come home again
No
they only went to sleep, and they will not wake
till to-morrow morning, when I pass in again. They will think I have
been absent for a day, and so will the apple-woman. You must not
undeceive them; if you do, they will be very angry
And who is the apple-woman
Queen, who is the apple-woman
I've only had her for a very little while
And how long do you think you have been a slave. Queen
I don't know
I have never been able to make up my
mind about that
If nobody
thanks the ducks for towing us I will
Thank you, ducks; we are very much obliged to you
It is certain;
    We doubt it no more
Than to-morrow that night's dusky curtain
    Shall roll back its folds for the day
Master
Well
They didn't invent that song themselves
the old
apple-woman taught it to them,-- the woman whom they love because she
can make them cry
Here the boat stopped, and the Queen rose and got out
Well, master, don't you feel hungry? Why
don't you go with the others and have some breakfast
The Queen didn't invite me
But do you feel as if you couldn't go
Of course not
but perhaps I may not
Oh, yes, master
whatever you _can_ do in
Fairyland you _may_ do
Are you sure of that
Quite sure, master
and I am hungry too
Well
I will go there and take Mopsa. She shall ride on
my shoulder; you may follow
Master, whatever you
can do you may do
Where is our trusty and well-beloved,
the apple-woman
O Jack, I am so glad to see
you
What a
delightful little creature that is! She can laugh! Perhaps she can
also cry
How are you, dear
I am as well as can be expected
Now, then, where's my tea? They're never
ready with my cup of tea
Mopsa
you are very naughty; if you behave in this way,
I shall never take you out to parties again
Pretty lamb
It's just like a child
It's many a long
day since I've seen a child. Oh dear! oh deary me
Oh dear! oh dear
we're crying; we can
cry just as well as men and women. Isn't it delightful? What a luxury
it is to cry, to be sure
I should like vastly well to be her nurse
If you'll always wash her, and put clean frocks on her, you may
for just look at her,-- what a figure she is already
Come away! come away! She is going to tell one of
her stories; and if you listen, you'll be obliged to go to sleep, and
sleep nobody knows how long
It was lucky, master, that I came when I did
for a
dozen or so of those one-foot-one fellows were just shoving it off,
and you will want it at night to sleep in
Yes
and I can stretch the bit of purple silk to make a
canopy over head,-- a sort of awning,-- for I should not like to sleep
in tents or palaces that are inclined to melt away
Where are all the fairies gone to
I never take any notice of that common trash and their doings
When the Queen takes to telling her stories they are
generally frightened, and go and sit in the tops of the trees
But you seem very fond of Mopsa
and she is one of them.
You will help me to take care of her, won't you, tills she grows a
little older
Grows
Grows! Why you don't think,
surely, that she will ever be any different from what she is now
I thought she would grow up
They never change so long as they last
when once they are one-foot-one high
Mopsa
come here, and I'll measure you
It is because
I shall never see my own country any
more, nor any men and women and children, excepting such as by a rare
chance stray in for a little while as you have done
I can go back whenever I please
Why don't you
Because I came in of my own good-will, after I had had fair warning
that if I came at all it would end in my staying always. Besides, I
don't know that I exactly wish to go home again: I should be afraid
Afraid of what
Why, there's the rain and the cold, and not having anything to eat
excepting what you earn. And yet
I have three
boys of my own at home; one of them must be nearly a man by this time,
and the youngest is about as old as you are. If I went home I might
find one or more of those boys in jail, and then how miserable I
should be
But you are not happy as it is
I have seen you cry
Yes
but now I live here I don't care about
anything so much as I used to do. 'May I have a satin gown and a
coach?' I asked, when first I came. 'You may have a hundred and fifty
satin gowns if you like,' said the Queen, 'and twenty coaches with six
cream-colored horses to each.' But when I had been here a little time,
and found I could have everything I wished for, and change it as
often as I pleased, I began not to care for anything; and at last I
got so sick of all their grand things that I dressed myself in my own
clothes that I came in, and made up my mind to have a stall and sit at
it, as I used to do, selling apples. And I used to say to myself, 'I
have but to wish with all my heart to go home, and I can go, I know
that;' but oh dear! oh dear! I couldn't wish enough, for it would come
into my head that I should be poor, or that my boys would have
forgotten me, or that my neighbors would look down on me, and so I
always put off wishing for another day. Now here is the Queen coming.
Sit down on the grass and play with Mopsa. Don't let her see us
talking together, lest she should think I have been telling you things
which you ought not to know
Don't you listen to a word she says
pull'e haul'e, pull'e haul'e, yoy! heave, hoy
pull'e haul'e, pull'e haul'e, yoy! heave, hoy
pull'e haul'e, pull'e haule, yoy! heave, hoy
Will ye step aboard, my dearest? for the high seas lie before us
pull'e haul'e, pull'e haul'e, yoy! heave, hoy
Does the Queen tell stories of what has happened, or of what is going
to happen
Why, of what is going to happen, of course
Anybody could tell the other sort
Because I heard a little of it
I thought she was
talking of me. She said 'So he took the measure, and Mopsa stood
still for once, and he found she was only one foot high, and she grew
a great deal after that. Yes, she can grow
That's a fine hearing, and a strange hearing
and what did she mutter next
Of how she heard me sobbing
and while you went on
about stepping on board the ship, she said, 'He was very good to me,
dear little fellow! But Fate is the name of my old mother, and she
reigns here. Oh, she reigns! The fatal F is in her name, and I cannot
take it out
Ah
they all say that, and that they are
fays, and that mortals call their history fable; they are always
crying out for an alphabet without the fatal F
And then she told how she heard Mopsa sobbing too
sobbing among the reeds and rushes by the river side
There are no reeds, and no rushes either, here
and I have walked the river from end to end. I don't
think much of that part of the story. But you are sure she said that
Mopsa was short of her proper height
Yes, and that she would grow; but that's nothing. In my country we
always grow
Hold your tongue about you country
Do you want to make enemies of them all
I don't love the
Queen. She slapped my arm as she went by, and it hurts
That's odd, too
there's nothing red in a
common fairy's veins. They have sap in them: that's why they can't
blush
Jack!
Jack
O Jack! I'm so
big
I grew in the night; look at me
But I hope you will not go on growing so fast as this
or you will be as tall as my mamma is in a week or two,-- much too big
for me to play with
How ashamed I am
to think that you don't know even your
letters
Where is the Queen
It's not the fashion to ask questions in
Fairyland
That's a pity
for there are several things that I
particularly want to know about this country. Mayn't I even ask how
big it is
How big
Why, the same size as your world, of course
It's the same world that you call yours
and when I'm a little older, I'll explain it all to you
If it's our world
why are none of us in it, excepting
me and the apple-woman
That's because you've got something in your world that you call
TIME
so you talk about NOW, and you talk about THEN
And don't you
I do if I want to make you understand
To think of the pretty thing
talking so queen-like already! Yes, that's right, and just what the
grown-up fairies say. Go on, and explain it to him if you can
You know
that your people say there was a time when
there were none of them in the world,-- a time before they were made.
Well, THIS is that time. This is long ago
Nonsense
Then how do I happen to be here
Because
when the albatross brought you, she did not
fly with you a long way off, but a long way back,-- hundreds and
hundreds of years. This is your world, as you can see; but none of
your people are here, because they are not made yet. I don't think any
of them will be made for a thousand years
But I saw the old ships
in the enchanted bay
That was a border country
I was asleep while you went
through those countries; but these are the real Fairylands
Oh, Mopsa, how old we are! We have
lived back to the times before Adam and Eve
Yes
but I don't feel old. Let us go down the river,
and see what we can find
I hope they won't upset us
I wish you would land
There are no such things as hairy elephants
Odious
What terrible creatures these
are
Well
then why do you dream of them
O Jack
if you can't dream any better, I must
call the Craken
Very well
I'm almost wrapped up and smothered in bats'
wings, so call anything you please
We are caught in
this crowd of creatures, and we cannot get away from the land of
dreams. Do help us, Craken
You can swim your boat home under my coils where the water is calm
for she is so extremely old now, that if you do not
take care she will drop to pieces before you get back to the present
time
It's only a fabled monster
No, it's only a fable to these times
but in spite of that we shall have to go through all the
rings
No! that I cannot bear.
Somebody else may do the rest of this dream. I shall jump overboard
No, you'd much better wake
Jack! Jack! why
don't you wake
_I_ did not put him to sleep. _I_ did not put him
to sleep
We don't want any more stories to-day, Queen
The arrow it sped to thy brown mate's breast;
    Low in the broom is thy mate to-day
Liest thou low, love? low in the broom?
    Feathers and moss, and a wisp of hay,
  Warm the white eggs till I learn his doom
Ah, my sweet singer, thy days are told
    (Feathers and moss, and a wisp of hay)!
  Thine eyes are dim, and the eggs grow cold.
    O mournful morrow! O dark to-day
good-bye
You must not go on to that carpet
let us sit
still in the boat, and be served here
Good-morning, Jack
Good-morning, dear
Well
don't you mean to speak to me
Good morning ---- sister
I said so
I said so
What is to be done now
Never mind, Queen dear
If it was rude of Mopsa to say
that, she is such a little young thing that she does not know
better
It was not rude
It
was not rude, and I am not sorry
When is the breakfast coming
This is the breakfast
these flowers are most
delicious eating. You never tasted anything so good in your life; but
we don't begin till the Queen does
I want to whisper to you, sister
Oh
I wish I was in Jack's waistcoat pocket again; but
I'm so big now
My old mother sent a message last night
She is much more powerful than we are
What is the message
There cannot be two Queens in one hive
If Mopsa leaves the hive, a fine swarm will go with her
I shall, for one; that I shall
No
I hope not, dear; for you know well that
this is my old mother's doing, not mine
Oh
I feel as if I must tell a story too, just as the
Queen does
It's not at all like Fairyland, if you go on in this way, and I would
as lieve be out of it as in it
What need?
  'Tis a lass in any weed
          Aye bonny
Good-by
I must go and prepare
for the deputation
What was the name of the great bird that carried you
two here
I have forgotten
I've been trying to remember ever
since we heard the Queen tell her first story, but I cannot
I remember
Tell it then
I don't want Jack to go
I don't want to go, nor that you should
But the Queen said, 'there cannot be two queens in one hive,' and
that means that you are going to be turned out of this beautiful
country
The other fairy lands are just as nice
she can
only turn me out of this one
I never heard of more than one Fairyland
It's my opinion
that there are hundreds! And
those one-foot-one fairies are such a saucy set, that if I were you I
should be very glad to get away from them. You've been here a very
little while as yet, and you've no notion what goes on when the leaves
begin to drop
Tell us
Well, you must know
that fairies cannot
abide cold weather; so, when the first rime frost comes, they bury
themselves
Bury themselves
Yes, I tell you, they bury themselves. You've seen fairy rings, of
course, even in your own country; and here the fields are full of
them. Well, when it gets cold, a company of fairies forms itself into
a circle, and every one digs a little hole. The first that has
finished jumps into his hole, and his next neighbor covers him up,
and then jumps into his own little hole, and he gets covered up in his
turn, till at last there is only one left, and he goes and joins
another circle, hoping he shall have better luck than to be last
again. I've often asked them why they do that, but no fairy can ever
give a reason for anything. They always say that old Mother Fate makes
them do it. When they come up again, they are not fairies at all, but
the good ones are mushrooms, and the bad ones are toadstools
Then you think there are no one-foot-one fairies in the other
countries
Of course not
all the fairy lands are
different. It's only the queens that are alike
I wish the fairies would not disappear for hours
They
all seem to run off and hide themselves
That's their way
So she began to sing
A great many are now with the Queen, because there is a deputation
coming; but if I were to begin to sing, such a flock of Guinea-hens
would gather round, that the boughs of the trees would bend with their
weight, and they would light on the grass all about so thickly that
not a blade of grass would be seen as far as the song was heard
All is made afresh for us, and the brave heart wins
Here's the deputation
Remember, Jack, whatever you can do you may do
Jack and Mopsa, I love you both. I had a message last night from my
old mother, and I told you what it was
Yes, Queen
you did
And now
she has sent this beautiful brown doe
from the country beyond the lake, where they are in the greatest
distress for a queen, to offer Mopsa the crown; and, Jack, it is fated
that Mopsa is to reign there, so you had better say no more about
it
I don't want to be a queen
I want to play
with Jack
You are a queen already
at least, you
will be in a few days. You are so much grown, even since the morning,
that you come up nearly to Jack's shoulder. In four days you will be
as tall as I am; and it is quite impossible that any one of fairy
birth should be as tall as a queen in her own country
But I don't see what stags and does can want with a queen
They were obliged to turn into deer
when they
crossed their own border; but they are fairies when they are at home,
and they want Mopsa, because they are always obliged to have a queen
of alien birth
If I go
shall Jack go too
Oh, no
Jack and the apple-woman are my
subjects
Apple-woman
tell us what you think; shall Mopsa go to
this country
Why, child
go away from here she must; but
she need not go off with the deer, I suppose, unless she likes. They
look gentle and harmless; but it is very hard to get at the truth in
this country, and I've heard queer stories about them
Have you
Well, you can repeat them if you like;
but remember that the poor brown doe cannot contradict them
I have heard, but I don't know how true it
is, that in that country they shut up their queen in a great castle,
and cover her with a veil, and never let the sun shine on her; for if
by chance the least little sunbeam should light on her she would turn
into a doe directly, and all the nation would turn with her, and stay
so
I don't want to be shut up in a castle
But is it true
Well
as I told you before, I cannot make out
whether it's true or not, for all these stags and fawns look very
mild, gentle creatures
I won't go
I would rather run away
Now, boat, if you are my boat, set off as fast as you can, and let
nothing of fairy birth get on board of you
The boat swung itself away from the edge, and almost in a moment it was
in the very middle of the river
Jack
will you give me your little
purse that has the silver fourpence in it
O my bones! Dearie, dearie me, how they do ache
For on the
other side of those peaks
I have heard that fairies live
who have the best of characters for being kind and just. I am sure
they would never shut up a poor queen in a castle.

"But the best thing you could do, dear
would be
to let Jack call the bird, and make her carry you back to his own
country
The Queen is not at all kind
I have been very kind to
her, and she should have let Mopsa stay
No, Jack, she could not
but I wish I had not grown so
fast, and I don't like to go to your country. I would rather run
away
But who is to tell us where to run
Oh
some of these people
I don't see anybody
I wish you would ask the
inhabitants a few questions, dear, before I go, for I want to know
whether they can put you in the way how to cross the purple
mountains
Dear
I wish you would wake
Dear!
why don't you wake? You had better wake now; the baby's crying
I am only a stone
Then
I am not a queen yet. I cannot wake her. Take me
down
I am not warm
What was it that you wished me to tell
you
How to find the way over those purple mountains
You must set off in an hour, then
You can easily find it by
night without any guide, but nothing can ever take you to it by
day
But we would rather stay a few days in this curious country
let us wait at least till to-morrow night
You are quite welcome to stay
but you had better not
Why not
Father
Wake up
Why not? Why, because it's full moon to-night at midnight, and
the moment the moon is past the full your Queen, whose country you
have just left, will be able to cross over the little stream, and she
will want to take you and that other mortal back. She can do it, of
course, if she pleases; and we can afford you no protection, for by
that time we shall be stones again. We are only people two hours out
of the twenty-four
That is very hard
No
it comes to the same
thing, as we live twelve times as long as others do
Can you tell us anything of the land beyond the mountains
Yes
Of all fairy lands it is the best; the people
are the gentlest and kindest
Then I had better take Mopsa there than down the river
You can't take her down the river
Why not
I have a boat
Yes, sir
but where is it now
Where is it now
It does not signify, Jack, for I feel that no place is the right
place for me but that country beyond the purple mountains, and I
shall never be happy unless we go there
You are not exactly fairies, I suppose
If you were, you
could go to our country when you pleased
No
we are not exactly fairies; but we shall be
more like them when our punishment is over
I am sorry you are punished
for you seem very nice,
kind people
We were not always kind
and perhaps we are
only kind now because we have no time, and no chance of being
otherwise. I'm sure I don't know about that. We were powerful once,
and we did a cruel deed. I must not tell you what it was. We were told
that our hearts were all as cold as stones,-- and I suppose they
were,-- and we were doomed to be stones all our lives, excepting for
the two hours of twilight. There was no one to sow the crops, or water
the grass, so it all failed, and the trees died, and our houses fell,
and our possessions were stolen from us
It is a very sad thing
When you are tired
eat the seeds, and they will
enable you to go running on. You can put the slice into this little
red pot, which has string handles to it, and you can hang it on your
arm. While you have it with you it will not turn to stone, but if you
lay it down it will, and then it will be useless
If I could only begin to be a queen
I could go
wherever I pleased. I am not a fairy, and yet I am not a proper queen.
Oh, what shall I do? I cannot go any farther
If you are not a queen yet
you will be by to-morrow
morning; for when our shadows danced on before us yours was so very
nearly the same height as mine, that I could hardly see any
difference
The dear little thing
how its heart beats. Is it frightened
Who are you
What is your name
Wisp
Uncurl yourself, Wisp
Jack and I want to look at
you
It is only one of the air fairies
Pretty creature! It
never did any harm, and would like to do us good if it knew how, for
it knows that I shall be a queen very soon. Wisp, if you like, you may
go and tell your friends and relations that we want to cross over the
mountains, and if they can they may help us
Darling Jack, I am so dreadfully tired!
Give me some more melon-seeds
If we had anything to sit upon
they could carry us
over the pass
Jack
did you see anything particular as you came down
with the shooting-stars
No, I saw nothing so interesting as they were
I was
looking at them and watching how they squeaked to one another, and how
they had little hooks in their wings, with which they held the large
wing that we sat on
But I saw something
Just as the sun rose I looked
down, and in the loveliest garden I ever saw, and all among trees and
woods, I saw a most beautiful castle. O, Jack! I am sure that castle
is the place I am to live in, and now we have nothing to do but to
find it. I shall soon be a queen, and there I shall reign
Then I shall be king there
shall I
Yes, if you can
Of course, whatever you can do
you may do. And, Jack, this is a much better fairy country than either
the stony land or the other that we first came to, for this castle is
a real place! It will not melt away. There the people can work, they
know how to love each other: common fairies cannot do that, I know.
They can laugh and cry, and I shall teach them several things that
they do not know yet. Oh! do let us make haste and find the castle
This is very odd
I thought this was only a small bed of
reeds when we stepped into it; but really we must have walked a mile
already
There is my home that I shall live in
Mopsa! Mopsa
come away! come back
But I am determined to get her away from those creatures
she does not want to reign over deer
Jack, bring Jack some breakfast
What
has he got a face like mine, and a
name like mine too
I know you don't like me
Not like him
and pray what reason have you for
not liking my royal nephew
O dame
I see you know how to laugh
You are wiser
people than those whom I went to first; but the reason I don't like
you is, that you are so exactly like me
I am not
Only hear him, dame! You mean, I
suppose, that you are so exactly like me. I am sure I don't know what
you mean by it
Nor I either
It couldn't be helped, of course
Hush! hush
don't wake our dear little Queen.
Was it you, my royal nephew, who spoke last
Yes, dame
I won't eat it
Oh, yes, do, old fellow; it's not my fault, you
know
I am a queen now
Yes, my sweet Queen
I know you are
And you promise that you will be kind to me till I grow up
and love me, and teach me how to reign
Yes
and I will love you too, just as if you
were a mortal and I your mother
For I am only ten years old yet
and the throne is too
big for me to sit upon; but I am a queen
Is it three o'clock
We shall see about that
Jack, when I pulled the lining out of your pocket-book there was a
silver fourpence in it
Yes
and here it is
Is it real money
Are you sure you brought it with you
all the way from your own country
Yes
quite sure
Then, dear Jack
will you give it to me
I will
if you will send this boy away
How can I
Don't you know what happened
when the door closed? Has nobody told you
I did not see any one after I got into the place
There
was no one to tell anything,-- not even a fawn, nor the brown doe. I
have only seen down here these fairy people, and this boy, and this
lady
The lady is the brown doe
and this boy and the
fairies were the fawns
The sun came shining in as I stepped inside
and a long
beam fell down from the fairy dome across my feet. Do you remember
what the apple-woman told us,-- how it was reported that the brown doe
and her nation had a queen whom they shut up, and never let the sun
shine on her? That was not a kind or true report, and yet it came from
something that really happened
Yes, I remember
and if the sun did shine they were all
to be turned into deer
I dare not tell you all that story yet
but, Jack, as
the brown doe and all the fawns came up to greet me, and passed by
turns into the sunbeam, they took their own forms, every one of them,
because the spell was broken. They were to remain in the disguise of
deer till a queen of alien birth should come to them against her will.
I am a queen of alien birth, and did not I come against my will
Yes, to be sure
We thought all the time that we
were running away
If ever you come to Fairyland again
you can save
yourself the trouble of trying to run away from the old mother
I shall not 'come
because I shall not go,-- not for
a long while, at least. But the boy,-- I want to know why this boy
turned into another ME
Because he is the heir, of course
But I don't see that this is any reason at all
That's because you don't know how to argue
Why, the thing is as plain as possible
It may be plain to you
but it's no reason
No reason
no reason! when I like you the best of
anything in the world, and when I am come here to be queen? Of course,
when the spell was broken he took exactly your form on that account;
and very right too
But why
And, dear Jack, will you give the silver fourpence to me
It will be very hot
But it will not burn me so as really to hurt, if I am a real queen
Oh, it's so hot
so very hot
Never mind, sweet Queen
it will not hurt you long.
Remember my poor uncle and all his knights
Pick it up
Give this a
name
I think it is a
Silence, sire! Don't you know that what it is first
called that it will be
That thing is a wand
You are a wand
Tell me, Jack, what can I do with a wand
You can make it point to anything that you please
I can make it point now
and it will point aright to
anything I please, whether I know where the thing is or not
The Queen has got a
wand,-- a wand! and she can make it point wherever she pleases
Where is Mopsa going? and why am I not to follow
They are going to put on her robes, of course
I am so tired of always hearing you say 'of course
and I wonder how it is that you always seem to know what is going to
be done without being told. However, I suppose you can't help being
odd people
I like you
very much, though you don't like me
Why do you like me
Most boys say Sire to me
at least they used to do when there were any boys here.
However, that does not signify. Why, of course I like you, because I
am so tired of being always a fawn, and you brought Mopsa to break the
spell. You cannot think how disagreeable it is to have no hands, and
to be all covered with hair. Now look at my hands; I can move them and
turn them everywhere, even over my head if I like. Hoofs are good for
nothing in comparison; and we could not talk
Do tell me about it
How did you become fawns
I dare not tell you
and listen!-- I hear Mopsa
I am much older,-- ah! so much older, now I have got my
wand. I can feel sorrow too, and _their_ sorrow weighs down my
heart
And so now I have no wings. But my thoughts can go up (Jovinian and
Roxaletta could not think). My thoughts are instead of wings; but they
have dropped with me now, as a lark among the clods of the valley.
Wand, do you bend? Yes, I am following, wand.

"And after that the bird said, 'I will come when you call me.' I never
have seen her moving overhead; perhaps she is out of sight. Flocks of
birds hover over the world, and watch it high up where the air is
thin. There are zones, but those in the lowest zone are far out of
sight.

"I have not been up there. I have no wings.

"Over the highest of the birds is the place where angels float and
gather the children's souls as they are set free.

"And so that woman told me,--(Wand, you bend again, and I will turn at
your bending),-- that woman told me how it was: for when the new king
was born, a black fairy with a smiling face came and sat within the
doorway. She had a spindle, and would always spin. She wanted to teach
them how to spin, but they did not like her, and they loved to do
nothing at all. So they turned her out.

"But after her came a brown fairy, with a grave face, and she sat on
the black fairy's stool and gave them much counsel. They liked that
still less; so they got spindles and spun, for they said, 'She will go
now, and we shall have the black fairy again.' When she did not go
they turned her out also, and after her came a white fairy, and sat in
the same seat. She did nothing at all, and she said nothing at all;
but she had a sorrowful face, and she looked up. So they were
displeased. They turned her out also; and she went and sat by the
edge of the lake with her two sisters.

"And everything prospered over all the land; till, after shearing-time,
the shepherds, because the king was a child, came to his uncle and
said, 'Sir, what shall we do with the old wool, for the new fleeces
are in the bales, and there is no storehouse to put them in?' So he
said, 'Throw them into the lake.'

"And while they threw them in, a great flock of finches flew to them,
and said, 'Give us some of the wool that you do not want; we should be
glad of it to build our nests with.'

"They answered, 'Go and gather for yourselves; there is wool on every
thorn.'

"Then the black fairy said, 'They shall be forgiven this time, because
the birds should pick wool for themselves.'

"So the finches flew away.

"Then the harvest was over, and the reapers came and said to the
child-king's uncle, 'Sir, what shall we do with the new wheat, for
the old is not half eaten yet, and there is no room in the
granaries?'

"He said, 'Throw that into the lake also.'

"While they were throwing it in, there came a great flight of the wood
fairies, fairies of passage from over the sea. They were in the form
of pigeons, and they alighted and prayed them, 'O, cousins! we are
faint with our long flight; give us some of that corn which you do not
want, that we may peck it and be refreshed.'

"But they said, 'You may rest on our land, but our corn is our own.
Rest awhile, and go and get food in your own fields.'

"Then the brown fairy said, 'They may be forgiven this once, but yet
it is a great unkindness.'

"And as they were going to pour in the last sackful, there passed a
poor mortal beggar, who had strayed in from the men and women's world,
and she said, 'Pray give me some of that wheat, O fairy people! for I
am hungry. I have lost my way, and there is no money to be earned
here. Give me some of that wheat, that I may bake cakes, lest I and my
baby should starve.'

"And they said, 'What is starve? We never heard that word before, and
we cannot wait while you explain it to us.'

"So they poured it all into the lake; and then the white fairy said,
'This cannot be forgiven them'; and she covered her face with her
hands and wept. Then the black fairy rose and drove them all before
her,-- the prince, with his chief shepherd and his reapers, his
courtiers and his knights; she drove them into the great bed of reeds,
and no one has ever set eyes on them since. Then the brown fairy went
into the palace where the king's aunt sat, with all her ladies and her
maids about her, and with the child-king on her knee.

"It was a very gloomy day.

"She stood in the middle of the hall, and said, 'Oh, you cold-hearted
and most unkind! my spell is upon you, and the first ray of sunshine
shall bring it down. Lose your present forms, and be of a more gentle
and innocent race, till a queen of alien birth shall come to reign
over you against her will.'

"As she spoke they crept into corners, and covered the dame's head
with a veil. And all that day it was dark and gloomy, and nothing
happened, and all the next day it rained and rained; and they thrust
the dame into a dark closet, and kept her there for a whole month, and
still not a ray of sunshine came to do them any damage; but the dame
faded and faded in the dark, and at last they said, 'She must come
out, or she will die; and we do not believe the sun will ever shine in
our country any more.' So they let the poor dame come out; and lo! as
she crept slowly forth under the dome, a piercing ray of sunlight
darted down upon her head, and in an instant they were all changed
into deer, and the child-king too.

"They are gentle now, and kind; but where is the prince? where are the
fairy knights and the fairy men?

"Wand! why do you turn
Who is stopping me
It may be a keyhole
but there is no key
Good-morning
Good-afternoon
I am the black fairy.
Work is a fine thing. Most people in your country can work
Yes
There are two spades
one for you, and
one for your double
I shall be a king when I am old enough, and must I dig like a
clown
As you please
Jack, I'm quite ready to begin if you are
But where are we to dig
There
Dig down as deep as you can
This is very jolly
indeed
Go on
Now you can stamp. Stamp on the stone, and
don't be afraid
I shall go in first, of course, because of my
rank
Very well
I don't mind. I shall say to myself that
you've gone in first to find the way for me, because you're my double.
Besides, now I think of it, our Queen always goes last in a
procession; so it's grand to go last. Pass in, Jack
No
now you have said that I will not. You
may go first
They are dry branches of trees
They are table-legs turned upside down
No; they are antlers
Unlock the
door
We shall not be safe till we see our new Queen.
Unlock the door; we see light coming through the keyhole
He had brought them
some meat on a bone:
  They were welcome to pick it or leave it alone
Do you think he knows manners
Hear the story, hear the story
Give us glory
Give us peace
Give us fame to sweeten duty
Give us beauty
Give us love
Oh, give us, crowned in youth with marriage
        glory,
            Give for all our life's dear story,
            Give us love, and give us peace
A very good song too
only you made a mistake in the first verse. What the dove really said
was, no doubt, 'Give us peas.' All kinds of doves and pigeons are very
fond of peas
It isn't peas, though
That is well. Cannot you let things alone for this
one day
Her name was Jenny, her name was Jenny
I will stay
they
cannot make me leave her. That would be too unkind
I will go in
there is nothing to prevent me
Jack
He lives there
He will play
there again, in his father's garden
Jack
Yes
I am here. What is it that you wish to say
I am come to give you back your kiss
Farewell
She stooped forward as she stood on the step, and kissed him
Her name was Jenny
Jenny! O Jenny! come
Here I am
I wish to go home
That is well
It was
a long time ago
Wake up now, Jack
we are at home
So soon
But it is evening; I thought
it would be morning
Fairy time is always six hours in advance of your time
I see glowworms down in the hedge, and the moon is just
rising
Good-by
make haste and run in, for the dews are
falling
Come down, O lady! to me
My shepherd lord, my shepherd love,
    What wilt thou, then, with me?
  My heart is gone out of my breast,
    And followeth on to thee
The white lambs feed in tender grass:
    With them and thee to bide,
  How good it were
Albeit the meads are wide.
  Oh! well is me
Take now this crook, my chosen, my fere
    And tend the flock full fain;
  Feed them, O lady, and lose not one,
    Till I shall come again
My will is thine,
    And my reward thy grace
My longing heart is full of love.
    When shall my loss be gain?
  My shepherd lord, I see him not,
    But he will come again
Mamma
I think it must
be time this man of ours was in bed
