Black Brothers
What a pity
my brothers never ask any body to
dinner. I'm sure, when they've got such a nice piece of mutton as this,
and nobody else has got so much as a piece of dry bread, it would do
their hearts good to have somebody to eat it with them
It must be the wind
nobody else would venture to knock
double knocks at our door
swallow tail
Hollo
that's not the way to answer the
door: I'm wet, let me in
I beg pardon, sir
I'm very sorry, but I really can't
Can't what
I can't let you in, sir,-- I can't, indeed; my brothers would beat me to
death, sir, if I thought of such a thing. What do you want, sir
Want
I want fire, and shelter;
and there's your great fire there blazing, cracking, and dancing on the
walls, with nobody to feel it. Let me in, I say; I only want to warm
myself
He does look _very_ wet
I'll just let him in for a quarter of an hour
That's a good boy
Never mind your
brothers. I'll talk to them
Pray, sir, don't do any such thing
I can't let you stay
till they come; they'd be the death of me
Dear me
I'm very sorry to hear that. How
long may I stay
Only till the mutton's done, sir
and it's very
brown
You'll soon dry there, sir
I beg pardon, sir
mayn't I take your cloak
No, thank you
Your cap, sir
I am all right, thank you
But,-- sir,-- I'm very sorry
but -- really,
sir,-- you're -- putting the fire out
It'll take longer to do the mutton, then
That mutton looks very nice
Can't
you give me a little bit
Impossible, sir
I'm very hungry
I've had nothing to eat
yesterday, nor to-day. They surely couldn't miss a bit from the
knuckle
They promised me one slice to-day, sir
I can give
you that, but not a bit more
That's a good boy
I don't care if I do
get beaten for it
What did you keep us waiting in the rain for
Ay! what for, indeed,
you little vagabond
Bless my soul
Amen
Who's that
I don't know, indeed, brother
How did he get in
My dear brother
he was so _very_ wet
Who are you, sir
What's your business
I'm a poor old man, sir
and I saw your fire through the window, and begged shelter for a
quarter of an hour
Have the goodness to walk out again, then
We've quite
enough water in our kitchen, without making it a drying house
It is a cold day to turn an old man out in, sir; look at my grey
hairs
Ay
there are enough of them to keep you warm. Walk
I'm very, very hungry, sir; couldn't you spare me a bit of bread before
I go
Bread, indeed
do you suppose we've nothing to do with
our bread, but to give it to such red-nosed fellows as you
Why don't you sell your feather
Out with
you
A little bit
Be off
Pray, gentlemen
Off, and be hanged
Gentlemen, I wish you a very good morning. At twelve o'clock
tonight I'll call again; after such a refusal of hospitality as I have
just experienced, you will not be surprised if that visit is the last I
ever pay you
If ever I catch you here again
A very pretty business, indeed, Mr. Gluck
Dish the
mutton, sir. If ever I catch you at such a trick again -- bless me, why,
the mutton's been cut
You promised me one slice, brother, you know
Oh! and you were cutting it hot, I suppose, and going to catch all the
gravy. It'll be long before I promise you such a thing again. Leave the
room, sir; and have the kindness to wait in the coal-cellar till I call
you
What's that
Only I
Sorry to incommode you
I'm afraid
your beds are dampish; perhaps you had better go to your brother's room:
I've left the ceiling on, there
You'll find my card on the kitchen table
Remember, the _last_ visit
Pray Heaven it may
Suppose we turn goldsmiths
It is a good knave's trade; we can put a great deal of
copper into the gold, without any one's finding it out
And no wonder
after being treated in that way
Ah
if that
river were really all gold, what a nice thing it would be
No, it wouldn't, Gluck
Bless me, what's that
Not at all, my boy
Bless me
what _is_ that
Lala-lira-la
Lala-lira-la
Hollo
Hollo! Gluck, my boy
Come, Gluck, my boy
I'm all
right; pour me out
Pour me out, I say
_Will_ you pour me out
I'm too hot
That's right
No, it wouldn't, Gluck,
my boy
Wouldn't it, sir
No
no, it wouldn't
Pray, sir
were you my mug
I
am
the King of the Golden River
I hope your Majesty is
very well
Listen
I am the King of what you mortals call the Golden River. The shape you
saw me in, was owing to the malice of a stronger king, from whose
enchantments you have this instant freed me. What I have seen of you,
and your conduct to your wicked brothers, renders me willing to serve
you; therefore, attend to what I tell you. Whoever shall climb to the
top of that mountain from which you see the Golden River issue, and
shall cast into the stream at its source, three drops of holy water, for
him, and for him only, the river shall turn to gold. But no one failing
in his first, can succeed in a second attempt; and if any one shall cast
unholy water into the river, it will overwhelm him, and he will become a
black stone
Oh
Oh,
dear, dear, dear me! My mug! my mug! my mug
Good morning, brother
have you any message for the King
of the Golden River
Three drops are enough
I may, at least, cool my lips with it
Water
Water! I am
dying
I have none
thou hast had thy share of life
Water indeed
I haven't half enough for myself
Water, indeed
I haven't half enough for
myself
Ha, ha
are you there? remember the prison bars, my boy.
Water, indeed! do you suppose I carried it all the way up here for
_you_
The little
king looked very kind
I don't think he will turn me into
a black stone
My son
I am faint with thirst, give me some of that water
Only pray don't drink it all
that no one could succeed, except in his first attempt
Poor beastie
it'll be dead when I come down again, if I
don't help it
Confound the
King and his gold too
Thank you
but don't be frightened, it's all
right
Why didn't you come
before
instead of sending me those rascally
brothers of yours, for me to have the trouble of turning into stones?
Very hard stones they make too
Oh dear me
have you really been so cruel
Cruel
they poured unholy water into my stream: do
you suppose I'm going to allow that
Why
I am sure, sir -- your majesty, I mean -- they got the
water out of the church font
Very probably
but
the water which has been refused to the cry of the
weary and dying, is unholy, though it had been blessed by every saint in
heaven; and the water which is found in the vessel of mercy is holy,
though it had been defiled with corpses
Cast these into
the river
and descend on the other side of the mountains
into the Treasure Valley. And so good speed
