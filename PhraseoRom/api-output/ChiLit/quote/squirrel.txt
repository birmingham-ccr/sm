Old Mr. Brown, will you favour us with permission to gather nuts upon
your island
Riddle me, riddle me, rot-tot-tote!
     A little wee man, in a red red coat!
     A staff in his hand, and a stone in his throat;
     If you'll tell me this riddle, I'll give you a groat
Mr. Brown, will you favour us with your gracious permission to gather
some more nuts
Old Mr. B! Riddle-me-ree!
     Hitty Pitty within the wall,
     Hitty Pitty without the wall;
     If you touch Hitty Pitty,
     Hitty Pitty will bite you

    'How many strawberries grow in the sea?'

      Flour of England, fruit of Spain,

    If you'll tell me this riddle, I'll give you a ring
Hum-a-bum! buzz! buzz! Hum-a-bum buzz!
      As I went over Tipple-tine
      I met a flock of bonny swine;
    Some yellow-nacked, some yellow backed!
      They were the very bonniest swine
      That e'er went over Tipple-tine
Humpty Dumpty lies in the beck,
     With a white counterpane round his neck,
     Forty doctors and forty wrights,
     Cannot put Humpty Dumpty to rights
Old Mr. B! Old Mr. B!
    Hickamore, Hackamore, on the King's kitchen door;
    All the King's horses, and all the King's men,
    Couldn't drive Hickamore, Hackamore,
    Off the King's kitchen door
Arthur O'Bower has broken his band,
     He comes roaring up the land!
     The King of Scots with all his power,
     Cannot turn Arthur of the Bower
