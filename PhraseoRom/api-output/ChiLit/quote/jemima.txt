I have not the patience to sit on a
nest for twenty-eight days; and no more have you, Jemima. You would let
them go cold; you know you would
I wish to hatch my own eggs; I will hatch them all by myself
Quack
Quack
Madam, have you lost your way
Ah! is that so? indeed
Indeed! how interesting! I wish I could meet with that fowl. I would
teach it to mind its own business
But as to a nest -- there is no difficulty: I have a sackful of feathers in
my wood-shed. No, my dear madam, you will be in nobody's way. You may sit
there as long as you like
This is my summer residence; you would not find my earth -- my winter
house -- so convenient
and I
will bring a bag of corn with me, so that I need never leave my nest until
the eggs are hatched. They might catch cold
Madam, I beg you not to trouble yourself with a bag; I will provide oats.
But before you commence your tedious sitting, I intend to give you a
treat. Let us have a dinner-party all to ourselves!

"May I ask you to bring up some herbs from the farm-garden to make a
savoury omelette? Sage and thyme, and mint and two onions, and some
parsley. I will provide lard for the stuff -- lard for the omelette
What are you doing with those
onions? Where do you go every afternoon by yourself, Jemima Puddle-duck
Come into the house as soon as you have looked at your eggs. Give me the
herbs for the omelette. Be sharp
