Oh, why can't you
remain like this for ever
Now don't interrupt
I have one pound seventeen here, and two and six at the office; I can
cut off my coffee at the office, say ten shillings, making two nine
and six, with your eighteen and three makes three nine seven, with five
naught naught in my cheque-book makes eight nine seven -- who is that
moving?-- eight nine seven, dot and carry seven -- don't speak, my own -- and
the pound you lent to that man who came to the door -- quiet, child -- dot
and carry child -- there, you've done it!-- did I say nine nine seven? yes,
I said nine nine seven; the question is, can we try it for a year on
nine nine seven
Of course we can, George
Remember mumps
Mumps one pound, that is what I have put down, but I daresay
it will be more like thirty shillings -- don't speak -- measles one five,
German measles half a guinea, makes two fifteen six -- don't waggle your
finger -- whooping-cough, say fifteen shillings
footer
I know she admires you tremendously, George
Yes, he is rather cocky
But who is he, my pet
He is Peter Pan, you know, mother
Besides
he would be grown up by this time
Oh no, he isn't grown up
and he is
just my size
Mark my
words
it is some nonsense Nana has been putting into their
heads; just the sort of idea a dog would have. Leave it alone, and it
will blow over
I do believe it is that Peter again
Whatever do you mean, Wendy
It is so naughty of him not to wipe his feet
What nonsense you talk, precious. No one can get into the house without
knocking
I think he comes in by the window
My love, it is three floors up
Were not the leaves at the foot of the window, mother
My child
why did you not tell me of this before
I forgot
He is sure to come back for it; let
us put it where he can get it easily without disturbing the children
It all comes of having a
dog for a nurse
I ought to have been specially careful on a Friday
No, no
I am responsible for it all. I,
George Darling, did it. MEA CULPA, MEA CULPA
If only I had not accepted that invitation to dine at 27
If only I had not poured my medicine into Nana's bowl
If only I had pretended to like the medicine
My liking for parties, George
My fatal gift of humour, dearest
My touchiness about trifles, dear master and mistress
It's true, it's true, they ought not to have had a dog for
a nurse
That fiend
I won't go to bed
I won't, I won't. Nana, it isn't six
o'clock yet. Oh dear, oh dear, I shan't love you any more, Nana. I tell
you I won't be bathed, I won't, I won't
I am happy to inform you, Mrs. Darling, that you are now a mother
Nobody wants me
I do
I so want a third child
Boy or girl
Boy
It was then that I rushed in like a tornado, wasn't it
Why, what is the matter, father dear
Matter
This tie, it will not tie
Not round my neck! Round the bed-post!
Oh yes, twenty times have I made it up round the bed-post, but round my
neck, no! Oh dear no! begs to be excused
I warn you of this, mother, that unless this tie is round my
neck we don't go out to dinner to-night, and if I don't go out to dinner
to-night, I never go to the office again, and if I don't go to the
office again, you and I starve, and our children will be flung into the
streets
Let me try, dear
How wildly we romped
Our last romp
O George, do you remember Michael suddenly said to me, 'How did you get
to know me, mother
I remember
They were rather sweet, don't you think, George
And they were ours, ours! and now they are gone
George, Nana is a treasure
No doubt, but I have an uneasy feeling at times that she looks upon the
children as puppies
Oh no, dear one, I feel sure she knows they have souls
I wonder
I wonder
It is nobody I know
but it does
look a scoundrel
We were still discussing it, you remember
when
Nana came in with Michael's medicine. You will never carry the bottle in
your mouth again, Nana, and it is all my fault
Be a man,
Michael
Won't; won't
Mother, don't pamper him
Michael, when I was
your age I took medicine without a murmur. I said, 'Thank you, kind
parents, for giving me bottles to make me well
That
medicine you sometimes take, father, is much nastier, isn't it
Ever so much nastier
and I would take it
now as an example to you, Michael, if I hadn't lost the bottle
I know where it is, father
I'll bring it
John
it's most beastly stuff. It's that nasty,
sticky, sweet kind
It will soon be over, father
I have been as quick as I could
You have been wonderfully quick
Michael
first
Father first
I shall be sick, you know
Come on, father
Hold your tongue, John
I thought you took it quite easily, father
That is not the point
The point is, that there is
more in my glass than in Michael's spoon
And it isn't fair: I would say it though it were with my last
breath; it isn't fair
Father, I am waiting
It's all very well to say you are waiting; so am I waiting
Father's a cowardly custard
So are you a cowardly custard
I'm not frightened
Neither am I frightened
Well, then, take it
Well, then, you take it
Why not both take it at the same time
Certainly
Are you ready, Michael
O father
What do you mean by 'O father
Stop that row,
Michael. I meant to take mine, but I -- I missed it
Look here, all of you
I have just thought of a
splendid joke. I shall pour my medicine into Nana's bowl, and she will
drink it, thinking it is milk
What fun
Nana, good dog
I have put a little milk into
your bowl, Nana
O George
it's your medicine
It was only a joke
Much good
my wearing myself to the
bone trying to be funny in this house
That's right
Coddle her!
Nobody coddles me. Oh dear no! I am only the breadwinner, why should I
be coddled -- why, why, why
George
not so loud; the servants
will hear you
Let them
Bring in the whole world. But I
refuse to allow that dog to lord it in my nursery for an hour longer
In vain, in vain
the proper place for you is the yard, and there you go to be tied up
this instant
George, George
remember what I told you
about that boy
It is because he is chaining her up in the yard
That is not Nana's unhappy bark
that is her bark when she smells danger
Are you sure, Wendy
Oh, yes
Oh, how I wish that I wasn't going to a party to-night
Can anything harm us, mother, after the night-lights are lit
Nothing, precious
they are the eyes a mother leaves behind
her to guard her children
Mother
I'm glad of you
Now, Peter
Tinker Bell
Tink, where are you
Oh, do come out of that jug, and tell me, do you know where they put my
shadow
Boy
why are you crying
What's your name
Wendy Moira Angela Darling
What
is your name
Peter Pan
Is that all
Yes
I'm so sorry
It doesn't matter
Second to the right
and then straight on till morning
What a funny address
No, it isn't
I mean
is that
what they put on the letters
Don't get any letters
But your mother gets letters
Don't have a mother
O Peter, no wonder you were crying
I wasn't crying about mothers
I was
crying because I can't get my shadow to stick on. Besides, I wasn't
crying
It has come off
Yes
How awful
It must be sewn on
What's sewn
You're dreadfully ignorant
No, I'm not
I shall sew it on for you, my
little man
I daresay it will hurt a little
Oh, I shan't cry
Perhaps I should have ironed it
How clever I
am
oh, the cleverness of me
You conceit &lsqb;braggart
of course I did nothing
You did a little
A little
if I am no use I can at
least withdraw
Wendy
don't withdraw. I can't help crowing, Wendy, when
I'm pleased with myself
Wendy
Wendy, one girl is more use than twenty
boys
Do you really think so, Peter
Yes, I do
I think it's perfectly sweet of you
and I'll get up
again
Surely you know what a kiss is
I shall know when you give it to me
Now
shall I give you a kiss
If you please
I don't know
but I am quite young
Wendy, I ran away the day I was born
It was because I heard father and mother
talking about what I was to be when I became a man
I don't want ever to be a man
I want always to be a little boy and to have fun. So
I ran away to Kensington Gardens and lived a long long time among the
fairies
You see, Wendy, when the first baby laughed for the first time, its
laugh broke into a thousand pieces, and they all went skipping about,
and that was the beginning of fairies
And so
there ought to be one fairy for
every boy and girl
Ought to be? Isn't there
No. You see children know such a lot now, they soon don't believe in
fairies, and every time a child says, 'I don't believe in fairies,'
there is a fairy somewhere that falls down dead
I can't think where
she has gone to
Peter
you don't mean to tell me that there
is a fairy in this room
She was here just now
You don't hear
her, do you
The only sound I hear
is like a tinkle of bells
Well, that's Tink, that's the fairy language. I think I hear her too
Wendy
I do believe I shut her up in the
drawer
You shouldn't say such things
Of course I'm very sorry, but how could I know you were in the drawer
O Peter
if she would only
stand still and let me see her
They hardly ever stand still
O the lovely
Tink
this lady says she wishes you were her
fairy
What does she say, Peter
She is not very polite. She says you are a great
&lsqb;huge&rsqb; ugly girl, and that she is my fairy
You know you can't be my fairy, Tink,
because I am an gentleman and you are a lady
You silly ass
She is quite a common fairy
she is called Tinker Bell because she mends the pots
and kettles &lsqb;tinker = tin worker
If you don't live in Kensington Gardens now
Sometimes I do still
But where do you live mostly now
With the lost boys
Who are they
They are the children who fall out of their perambulators when the
nurse is looking the other way. If they are not claimed in seven
days they are sent far away to the Neverland to defray expenses. I'm
captain
What fun it must be
Yes
but we are rather lonely. You see we have no
female companionship
Are none of the others girls
Oh, no; girls, you know, are much too clever to fall out of their
prams
I think
it is perfectly
lovely the way you talk about girls; John there just despises us
And I know you meant to be kind
so you may give me a kiss
I thought
you would want it back
Oh dear
I don't mean a kiss, I mean a thimble
What's that
It's like this
Funny
Now shall I give you a thimble
If you wish to
What is it,
Wendy
It was exactly as if someone were pulling my hair
That must have been Tink. I never knew her so naughty before
She says she will do that to you, Wendy, every time I give you a
thimble
But why
Why, Tink
You silly ass
You see, I don't know any stories. None of the lost boys knows any
stories
How perfectly awful
Do you know
why swallows build in the eaves of houses?
It is to listen to the stories. O Wendy, your mother was telling you
such a lovely story
Which story was it
About the prince who couldn't find the lady who wore the glass
slipper
Peter
that was Cinderella, and he found her,
and they lived happily ever after
Where are you going
To tell the other boys
Don't go Peter
I know such lots of stories
Oh, the stories I could tell to the boys
Let me go
Wendy, do come with me and tell the other boys
Oh dear, I
can't. Think of mummy! Besides, I can't fly
I'll teach you
Oh, how lovely to fly
I'll teach you how to jump on the wind's back, and then away we go
Oo
Wendy, Wendy, when you are sleeping in your silly bed you might be
flying about with me saying funny things to the stars
Oo
And, Wendy, there are mermaids
Mermaids! With tails
Such long tails
Oh
to see a mermaid
Wendy
how we should all
respect you
Wendy
you could tuck us in at night
Oo
None of us has ever been tucked in at night
Oo
And you could darn our clothes, and make pockets for us. None of us has
any pockets
Of course it's awfully fascinating
Peter, would you teach John and Michael to fly too
If you like
Wake up
Peter Pan has come and he is to
teach us to fly
Then I shall get up
Hallo
I am up
Out with the light! Hide! Quick
There, you suspicious brute
They are perfectly safe, aren't they? Every one of the little
angels sound asleep in bed. Listen to their gentle breathing
No more of it, Nana
I warn you if you bark again I shall go straight
for master and missus and bring them home from the party, and then, oh,
won't master whip you, just
It's all right
I
say, Peter, can you really fly
How topping
How sweet
Yes, I'm sweet, oh, I am sweet
I say, how do you do it
You just think lovely wonderful thoughts
and they
lift you up in the air
You're so nippy at it
couldn't you do it very slowly
once
I've got it now, Wendy
Now just wiggle your shoulders this way
and let go
I flewed
Oh, lovely
Oh, ripping
Look at me
Look at me
Look at me
I say
why shouldn't we all go out
Mermaids
Oo
And there are pirates
Pirates
let us go at once
Cave, Peter
Come
Second to the right, and straight on till morning
There he goes again
Save him, save him
Do be more polite to him
Follow my Leader
Then tell him to stop showing off
You must be nice to him
What could
we do if he were to leave us
We could go back
How could we ever find our way back without him
Well, then, we could go on
That is the awful thing, John. We should have to go on, for we don't
know how to stop
And who is to get food for us, John
I nipped a bit out of that eagle's mouth pretty neatly, Wendy
After the twentieth try
And even though we
became good at picking up food, see how we bump against clouds and things
if he is not near to give us a hand
And if he forgets them so quickly
how can we expect
that he will go on remembering us
I'm Wendy
I say, Wendy
always if you
see me forgetting you, just keep on saying 'I'm Wendy,' and then I'll
remember
We get off here
There it is
Where, where
Where all the arrows are pointing
John, there's the lagoon
Wendy, look at the turtles burying their eggs in the sand
I say, John, I see your flamingo with the broken leg
Look, Michael, there's your cave
John, what's that in the brushwood
It's a wolf with her whelps. Wendy, I do believe that's your little
whelp
There's my boat, John, with her sides stove in
No, it isn't. Why, we burned your boat
That's her, at any rate. I say, John, I see the smoke of the redskin
camp
Where? Show me, and I'll tell you by the way smoke curls whether they
are on the war-path
There, just across the Mysterious River
I see now. Yes, they are on the war-path right enough
They don't want us to land
Who are they
Would you like an adventure now
or would you like to have your tea first
What kind of adventure
There's a pirate asleep in the pampas just beneath us
If you like, we'll go down and kill him
I don't see him
I do
Suppose
he were to wake up
You don't think I would kill him while he was
sleeping! I would wake him first, and then kill him. That's the way I
always do
I say! Do you kill many
Tons
How ripping
Who is captain now
Hook
Jas. Hook
Ay
He was Blackbeard's bo'sun
He is the worst
of them all. He is the only man of whom Barbecue was afraid
That's him
What is he like? Is he big
He is not so big as he was
How do you mean
I cut off a bit of him
You
Yes, me
I wasn't meaning to be disrespectful
Oh, all right
But, I say, what bit
His right hand
Then he can't fight now
Oh, can't he just
Left-hander
He has an iron hook instead of a right hand, and he claws with it
Claws
I say, John
Yes
Ay, ay, sir
There is one thing
that every boy who serves under
me has to promise, and so must you
It is this, if we meet Hook in open fight, you must leave him to me
I promise
She tells me
that the pirates sighted us before the
darkness came, and got Long Tom out
The big gun
Yes. And of course they must see her light, and if they guess we are
near it they are sure to let fly
Wendy
John
Michael
Tell her to go away at once, Peter
She thinks we have lost the way
and she is
rather frightened. You don't think I would send her away all by herself
when she is frightened
Then tell her
to put out her light
She can't put it out. That is about the only thing fairies can't do. It
just goes out of itself when she falls asleep, same as the stars
Then tell her to sleep at once
She can't sleep except when she's sleepy. It is the only other thing
fairies can't do
Seems to me
these are the only two things worth
doing
If only one of us had a pocket
we could carry her in
it
If
only something would make a sound
Where are they, where are they, where are they
Are you shot
I haven't tried &lsqb;myself out&rsqb; yet
Follow me, and all will be
well
Stand forth the one who
did this thing
Avast belay, yo ho, heave to,
     A-pirating we go,
     And if we're parted by a shot
     We're sure to meet below
I do wish Peter would come back
I am the only one who is not afraid of the pirates
but I wish he
would come back, and tell us whether he has heard anything more about
Cinderella
All I remember about my mother
is that she often
said to my father, 'Oh, how I wish I had a cheque-book of my own!' I
don't know what a cheque-book is, but I should just love to give my
mother one
Yo ho, yo ho, the pirate life,
     The flag o' skull and bones,
     A merry hour, a hempen rope,
     And hey for Davy Jones
Captain, let go
Put back that pistol first
It was one of those boys you hate. I could have shot him dead
Ay, and the sound would have brought Tiger Lily's redskins upon us. Do
you want to lose your scalp
Shall I after him, Captain
and tickle him
with Johnny Corkscrew
Johnny's a silent fellow
Not now, Smee
He is only one, and I want to
mischief all the seven. Scatter and look for them
Most of all
I want their captain,
Peter Pan. 'Twas he cut off my arm
I've waited long to shake his hand with this. Oh, I'll
tear him
And yet
I have often heard you say that hook was worth a
score of hands, for combing the hair and other homely uses
Ay
if I was a mother I would pray to have my
children born with this instead of that
Peter flung my arm
to a crocodile that happened to
be passing by
I have often
noticed your strange dread of crocodiles
Not of crocodiles
but of that one crocodile
It liked my arm so much, Smee, that it has followed
me ever since, from sea to sea and from land to land, licking its lips
for the rest of me
In a way
it's sort of a compliment
I want no such compliments
I want Peter Pan,
who first gave the brute its taste for me
Smee
that crocodile would have had me before
this, but by a lucky chance it swallowed a clock which goes tick tick
inside it, and so before it can reach me I hear the tick and bolt
Some day
the clock will run down, and then he'll get
you
Ay
that's the fear that haunts
me
Smee
this
seat is hot
Odds bobs, hammer and tongs I'm burning
A chimney
Did you hear them say Peter Pan's from home
Unrip your plan, captain
To return to the ship
and
cook a large rich cake of a jolly thickness with green sugar on it.
There can be but one room below, for there is but one chimney. The silly
moles had not the sense to see that they did not need a door apiece.
That shows they have no mother. We will leave the cake on the shore
of the Mermaids' Lagoon. These boys are always swimming about there,
playing with the mermaids. They will find the cake and they will gobble
it up, because, having no mother, they don't know how dangerous 'tis to
eat rich damp cake
Aha, they will die
It's the wickedest, prettiest policy ever I heard of
Avast, belay, when I appear,
     By fear they're overtook;
     Nought's left upon your bones when you
     Have shaken claws with Hook
The crocodile
Save me, save me
But what can we do, what can we do
What would Peter do
Peter would look at them through
his legs
Let us do what Peter would do
I have seen a wonderfuller thing
A great white bird. It is flying this way
What kind of a bird, do you think
I don't know
but it looks so weary, and as it
flies it moans, 'Poor Wendy
Poor Wendy
I remember
there are birds called Wendies
See, it comes
Hullo, Tink
Peter wants you to shoot the Wendy
Let us do
what Peter wishes
Quick, bows and arrows
Quick, Tootles, quick
Peter will be so pleased
Out of the way, Tink
You are too late
I have shot the Wendy. Peter will
be so pleased with me
Silly ass
This is no bird
I think this must be a lady
A lady
And we have killed her
Now I see
Peter was bringing her to us
A lady to take care of us at last
and you
have killed her
I did it
When ladies used to come to me in
dreams, I said, 'Pretty mother, pretty mother.' But when at last she
really came, I shot her
Don't go
I must
I am so afraid of Peter
Peter
Hide her
Greetings, boys
I am back
why do you not cheer
Great news, boys
I have brought at last a mother for you
all
Have you not seen her
She flew this
way
Ah me
Oh, mournful day
Peter
I will show her to you
Back, twins, let
Peter see
She is dead
Perhaps she is frightened at
being dead
Whose arrow
Mine, Peter
Oh, dastard hand
Strike, Peter
strike true
I cannot
strike
there is something stays my hand
It is she
the Wendy lady, see, her arm
I think she said, 'Poor Tootles
She lives
The Wendy lady lives
See
the arrow struck against this. It is the kiss I gave
her. It has saved her life
I remember kisses
let me see it. Ay,
that's a kiss
Listen to Tink
she is crying because the Wendy lives
Listen, Tinker Bell
I am your friend no more. Begone from
me for ever
Well, not for ever, but for a whole week
Let us carry her down into the house
Ay
that is what one does with ladies
No, no
you must not touch her. It would not be
sufficiently respectful
That
is what I was thinking
But if she lies there
she will die
Ay, she will die
but there is no way out
Yes, there is
Let us build a little house round her
Quick
bring me each of you
the best of what we have. Gut our house. Be sharp
John, John
wake up! Where is Nana, John, and
mother
It is true, we did fly
Hullo, Peter
Hullo
Is Wendy asleep
Yes
John
let us wake her and get her to make supper
for us
Look at them
Curly
see that these boys
help in the building of the house
Ay, ay, sir
Build a house
For the Wendy
For Wendy
Why, she is only a girl
That
is why we are her servants
You? Wendy's servants
Yes
and you also. Away with them
Chairs and a fender &lsqb;fireplace&rsqb; first
Then we shall
build a house round them
Ay
that is how a house is built; it all comes back to
me
Slightly
fetch a doctor
Ay, ay
Please, sir
are you a doctor
Yes, my little man
Please, sir
a lady lies very ill
Tut, tut, tut
where does she lie
In yonder glade
I will put a glass thing in her mouth
How is she
Tut, tut, tut
this has cured her
I am glad
I will call again in the evening
give her beef tea
out of a cup with a spout to it
If only we knew
the kind of house she likes best
Peter
she is moving in her sleep
Her mouth opens
Oh,
lovely
Perhaps she is going to sing in her sleep
Wendy, sing
the kind of house you would like to have
I wish I had a pretty house,
     The littlest ever seen,
     With funny little red walls
     And roof of mossy green
We've built the little walls and roof
     And made a lovely door,
     So tell us, mother Wendy,
     What are you wanting more
Oh, really next I think I'll have
     Gay windows all about,
     With roses peeping in, you know,
     And babies peeping out
Roses
We've made the roses peeping out,
     The babes are at the door,
     We cannot make ourselves, you know,
     'cos we've been made before
There's no knocker on the door
There's no chimney
we must have a
chimney
It certainly does need a chimney
All look your best
first impressions are awfully
important
Where am I
Wendy lady
for you we built this house
Oh, say you're pleased
Lovely, darling house
And we are your children
O Wendy
lady, be our mother
Ought I
Of course it's frightfully
fascinating, but you see I am only a little girl. I have no real
experience
That doesn't matter
What we need is just a nice motherly person
Oh dear
you see, I feel that is exactly what I am
It is, it is
we saw it at once
Very well
I will do my best. Come inside at once, you
naughty children; I am sure your feet are damp. And before I put you to
bed I have just time to finish the story of Cinderella
Oh dear, I am sure
I sometimes think spinsters are to be envied
What
was the colour of Mother's eyes? Which was taller, Father or Mother? Was
Mother blonde or brunette? Answer all three questions if possible
A) Write an essay of not less than 40 words on How I spent my last
Holidays, or The Characters of Father and Mother compared. Only one of
these to be attempted
1) Describe Mother's laugh; (2) Describe
Father's laugh; (3) Describe Mother's Party Dress; (4) Describe the
Kennel and its Inmate
I'm redskin to-day; what are you,
Tootles
Redskin; what are you, Nibs
Redskin; what are you Twin
Pirates
Dive
Luff, you lubber
here's the
rock. Now, then, what we have to do is to hoist the redskin on to it and
leave her here to drown
Ahoy there, you lubbers
The captain
He must be swimming out to us
We are putting the redskin on the rock
Set her free
Free
Yes, cut her bonds and let her go
But, captain
At once, d'ye hear
or I'll plunge my hook in you
This is queer
Better do what the captain orders
Ay, ay
Boat ahoy
Boat ahoy
Am I not a wonder, oh, I am a wonder
Captain, is all well
He sighs
He sighs again
And yet a third time he sighs
The game's up
those boys have found a mother
O evil day
What's a mother
He doesn't know
What was that
I heard nothing
See
that is a mother. What
a lesson! The nest must have fallen into the water, but would the mother
desert her eggs? No
If she is a mother, perhaps she is
hanging about here to help Peter
Ay
that is the fear that haunts me
Captain
could we not kidnap these boys' mother and make
her our mother
It is a princely scheme
We will seize the children and carry them to
the boat: the boys we will make walk the plank, and Wendy shall be our
mother
Never
What was that
Do you agree, my bullies
There is my hand on it
And there is my hook. Swear
Where is the redskin
That is all right, captain
we let her
go
Let her go
Twas your own orders
You called over the water to us to let her go
Brimstone and gall
what cozening &lsqb;cheating&rsqb; is
going on here
Lads
I gave no such order
It is passing queer
Spirit that haunts this dark lagoon to-night
dost hear
me
Odds, bobs, hammer and tongs, I hear you
Who are you, stranger? Speak
I am James Hook
captain of the JOLLY ROGER
You are not; you are not
Brimstone and gall
say that again, and I'll cast
anchor in you
If you are Hook
come tell me, who am I
A codfish
only a codfish
A codfish
Have we been captained all this time by a codfish
It
is lowering to our pride
Don't desert me, bully
Hook
have you another voice
I have
And another name
Ay, ay
Vegetable
No
Mineral
No
Animal
Yes
Man
No
Boy
Yes
Ordinary boy
No
Wonderful boy
Yes
Are you in England
No
Are you here
Yes
You ask him some questions
I can't think of a thing
Can't guess, can't guess
Do you give it up
Yes, yes
Well, then
I am Peter Pan
Now we have him
Into the water, Smee. Starkey, mind
the boat. Take him dead or alive
Are you ready, boys
Ay, ay
Then lam into the pirates
They must be swimming back or
flying
Help, help
We are on the rock, Wendy
but it is growing smaller. Soon
the water will be over it
We must go
Yes
Shall we swim or fly, Peter
Do you think you could swim or fly as far as the island, Wendy, without
my help
What is it
I can't help you, Wendy. Hook wounded me. I can neither fly nor swim
Do you mean we shall both be drowned
Look how the water is rising
Can I
be of any use
Michael's kite
It lifted Michael off the ground
why should it not carry
you
Both of us
It can't lift two; Michael and Curly tried
Let us draw lots
And you a lady; never
Good-bye,
Wendy
To die will be an awfully big adventure
I -- want -- you -- to -- get -- into -- the -- nest
and -- then -- you -- can -- drift -- ashore,
but -- I -- am -- too -- tired -- to -- bring -- it -- any -- nearer -- so -- you -- must -- try
to -- swim -- to -- it
What are you quacking about
Why don't you let the
nest drift as usual
I -- want -- you
What -- are -- you -- quacking -- about
You dunderheaded little jay
Why don't you do as I tell
you
So are you
Shut up
Shut up
To bed, to bed
The great white father
is glad to see the Piccaninny warriors
protecting his wigwam from the pirates
Me Tiger Lily
Peter Pan save me,
me his velly nice friend. Me no let pirates hurt him
It is good. Peter Pan has
spoken
Peter Pan has spoken
How-do
Father knows
best
I complain of so-and-so
Silence
Is your mug empty, Slightly
darling
Not quite empty, mummy
He hasn't even begun to drink his milk
I complain of Nibs
Well, John
May I sit in Peter's chair, as he is not here
Sit in father's chair, John
Certainly not
He is not really our father
He didn't even know how a
father does till I showed him
We complain of John
I don't suppose
that I could be father
No, Tootles
As I can't be father
I don't suppose, Michael, you
would let me be baby
No, I won't
As I can't be baby
do you think I could be a twin
No, indeed
it's awfully difficult to be a twin
As I can't be anything important
would any of you like
to see me do a trick
No
I hadn't really any hope
Slightly is coughing on the table
The twins began with cheese-cakes
Curly is taking both butter and honey
Nibs is speaking with his mouth full
I complain of the twins
I complain of Curly
I complain of Nibs
Oh dear, oh dear
I'm sure I sometimes think that
spinsters are to be envied
Wendy
I'm too big for a cradle
I must have somebody in a cradle
and you
are the littlest. A cradle is such a nice homely thing to have about a
house
Children, I hear your father's step. He likes you to meet him at the
door
Watch well, braves. I have spoken
Peter, you just spoil them, you know
Ah, old lady
It was me told him mothers are called old lady
I complain of Michael
Father, we want to dance
Dance away, my little man
But we want you to dance
Me! My old bones would rattle
And mummy too
What
the mother of such an armful, dance
But on a Saturday night
Of course it is Saturday night, Peter
People of our figure, Wendy
But it is only among our own progeny &lsqb;children
True, true
Ah, old lady
there is nothing
more pleasant of an evening for you and me when the day's toil is over
than to rest by the fire with the little ones near by
It is sweet, Peter, isn't it
Peter, I think Curly has your nose
Michael takes after you
Dear Peter
with such a large family, of course, I have now
passed my best, but you don't want to &lsqb;ex&rsqb;change me, do you
No, Wendy
Peter, what is it
I was just thinking
It is only
make-believe, isn't it, that I am their father
Oh yes
You see
it would make me seem so old to
be their real father
But they are ours, Peter, yours and mine
But not really, Wendy
Not if you don't wish it
Peter
what are
your exact feelings to &lsqb;about&rsqb; me
Those of a devoted son, Wendy
I thought so
You are so queer
and Tiger Lily is just
the same. There is something she wants to be to me, but she says it is
not my mother
No, indeed, it is not
Then what is it
It isn't for a lady to tell
Oh, very well
Perhaps Tinker Bell will
tell me
Oh yes, Tinker Bell will tell you
She is
an abandoned little creature
She says she glories in being abandoned
Perhaps Tink wants to be my mother
You silly ass
I almost agree with her
Yes, it is a dull beginning. I say, let us pretend that it is the end
Listen, then
There was once a gentleman
I had rather he had been a lady
I wish he had been a white rat
Quiet
There was a lady
also, and
Oh, mummy
you mean that there is a lady also,
don't you? She is not dead, is she
Oh, no
I am awfully glad she isn't dead
Are you glad, John
Of course I am
Are you glad, Nibs
Rather
Are you glad, Twins
We are glad
Oh dear
Little less noise there
The gentleman's name
was Mr. Darling, and her name
was Mrs. Darling
I knew them
I think I knew them
They were married, you know
and what do you think
they had
White rats
No
It's awfully puzzling
Quiet, Tootles. They had three descendants
What is descendants
Well, you are one, Twin
Did you hear that, John? I am a descendant
Descendants are only children
Oh dear, oh dear
Now these three children had a
faithful nurse called Nana; but Mr. Darling was angry with her and
chained her up in the yard, and so all the children flew away
It's an awfully good story
They flew away
to the Neverland, where the lost
children are
I just thought they did
I don't know how
it is, but I just thought they did
O Wendy
was one of the lost children called Tootles
Yes, he was
I am in a story. Hurrah, I am in a story, Nibs
Hush. Now I want you to consider the feelings of the unhappy parents
with all their children flown away
Oo
Think of the empty beds
Oo
It's awfully sad
I don't see how it can have a happy ending
Do
you, Nibs
I'm frightfully anxious
If you knew how great is a mother's love
you would have no fear
I do like a mother's love
Do you like a mother's love, Nibs
I do just
You see
our heroine knew that the mother
would always leave the window open for her children to fly back by; so
they stayed away for years and had a lovely time
Did they ever go back
Let us now
take a peep into the future
Years have rolled by, and who
is this elegant lady of uncertain age alighting at London Station
O Wendy, who is she
Can it be -- yes -- no -- it is -- the fair Wendy
Oh
And who are the two noble portly figures accompanying her, now grown to
man's estate? Can they be John and Michael? They are
Oh
See, dear brothers,' says Wendy pointing upwards, 'there is the window
still standing open. Ah, now we are rewarded for our sublime faith in a
mother's love.' So up they flew to their mummy and daddy, and pen cannot
describe the happy scene, over which we draw a veil
What is it, Peter
Where is it, Peter
It isn't that kind of pain
Then what kind is it
Wendy, you are wrong about mothers
Long ago
I thought like you that my mother would always
keep the window open for me, so I stayed away for moons and moons and
moons, and then flew back; but the window was barred, for mother had
forgotten all about me, and there was another little boy sleeping in my
bed
Are you sure mothers are like that
Yes
Wendy, let us &lsqb;let's&rsqb; go home
Yes
Not to-night
At once
Perhaps mother is in half mourning by this time
Peter, will you make the necessary
arrangements
If you wish it
It will be worse than before she came
We shan't let her go
Let's keep her prisoner
Ay, chain her up
Tootles
I appeal to you
I am just Tootles
and nobody minds me. But the first who
does not behave to Wendy like an English gentleman I will blood him
severely
Wendy
I have asked the redskins to
guide you through the wood, as flying tires you so
Thank you, Peter
Then
Tinker Bell will take you across the sea. Wake her, Nibs
Who are you? How dare you? Go away
You are to get up, Tink
and take Wendy on a journey
She says she won't
Tink
if you don't get up and dress at once I will
open the curtains, and then we shall all see you in your negligee
&lsqb;nightgown
Who said I wasn't getting up
Dear ones
if you will all come with me I feel almost sure
I can get my father and mother to adopt you
But won't they think us rather a handful
Oh no
it will only mean having
a few beds in the drawing-room; they can be hidden behind the screens on
first Thursdays
Peter, can we go
All right
And now, Peter
I am going to give you your medicine before you go
Get your things, Peter
No
I am not going with you,
Wendy
Yes, Peter
No
To find your mother
No, no
perhaps she would say I was old,
and I just want always to be a little boy and to have fun
But, Peter
No
Peter isn't coming
If you find your mothers
I hope you will like them
Now then
no fuss, no blubbering; good-bye, Wendy
You will remember about changing your flannels, Peter
Yes
And you will take your medicine
Yes
Are you
ready, Tinker Bell
Ay, ay
Then lead the way
If the redskins have won
they will beat the tom-tom; it is
always their sign of victory
You will never hear the tom-tom again
The tom-tom
an Indian victory
Who is that
Who are you
I won't open unless you speak
Let me in, Peter
What is it
Oh, you could never guess
Out with it
I'll rescue her
No
Why not
It is poisoned
Poisoned? Who could have poisoned it
Hook
Don't be silly. How could Hook have got down here
Besides
I never fell asleep
Why, Tink, how dare you drink my medicine
What is the matter with you
It was poisoned, Peter
and now I am going to be
dead
O Tink, did you drink it to save me
Yes
But why, Tink
You
silly ass
Do you believe
What do you think
If you believe
clap your hands; don't let Tink
die
And now to rescue Wendy
Hook or me this time
Have you been good form to-day
Fame, fame, that glittering bauble, it is mine
Is it quite good form to be distinguished at anything
I am the only man whom Barbecue feared
and Flint feared
Barbecue
Barbecue, Flint -- what house
Better for Hook
if he had had less ambition
No little children to love me
Good form
To claw a man because he is good form, what would that be
Bad form
Quiet, you scugs
or I'll cast anchor in you
Are all the children chained, so that they cannot
fly away
Ay, ay
Then hoist them up
Now then, bullies
six of you walk the plank
to-night, but I have room for two cabin boys. Which of you is it to be
Don't irritate him unnecessarily
You see, sir, I don't think my mother
would like me to be a pirate. Would your mother like you to be a pirate,
Slightly
I don't think so
Would your mother like you to be a
pirate, Twin
I don't think so
Nibs,
would
Stow this gab
You,
boy
you look as if you had a little pluck
in you. Didst never want to be a pirate, my hearty
I once thought of calling myself Red-handed Jack
And a good name too. We'll call you that here, bully, if you join
What do you think, Michael
What would you call me if I join
Blackbeard Joe
What do you think, John
Shall we still be respectful subjects of the King
You would have to swear, 'Down
with the King
Then I refuse
And I refuse
Rule Britannia
That seals your doom. Bring up their mother. Get the plank ready
So, my beauty
you are to see
your children walk the plank
Are they to die
They are
Silence all
for a
mother's last words to her children
These are my last words, dear boys
I feel that I have a message to you from your real
mothers, and it is this: 'We hope our sons will die like English
gentlemen
I am
going to do what my mother hopes. What are you to do, Nibs
What my mother hopes. What are you to do, Twin
What my mother hopes. John, what are
Tie her up
See here, honey
I'll save you if you promise to be my mother
I would almost
rather have no children at all
The crocodile is about to board the ship
Hide me
Hook or me this
time
How clever of me
One
It's gone, captain
All's still
again
Then here's to Johnny Plank
Yo ho, yo ho, the frisky plank,
     You walks along it so,
     Till it goes down and you goes down
     To Davy Jones below
Do you want a touch of the cat &lsqb;o'
nine tails&rsqb; before you walk the plank
No, no
Fetch the cat, Jukes
it's in the cabin
Ay, ay
Yo ho, yo ho, the scratching cat,
     Its tails are nine, you know,
     And when they're writ upon your back
What was that
Two
What's the matter with Bill Jukes, you dog
The matter wi' him is he's dead, stabbed
Bill Jukes dead
The cabin's as black as a pit
but
there is something terrible in there: the thing you heard crowing
Cecco
go back and fetch me out
that doodle-doo
Did you say you would go, Cecco
Three
S'death and odds fish
who is to bring me that doodle-doo
Wait till Cecco comes out
I think I heard you volunteer, Starkey
No, by thunder
My hook thinks you did
I wonder if it
would not be advisable, Starkey, to humour the hook
I'll swing before I go in there
Is this mutiny
Starkey's
ringleader
Captain, mercy
Shake hands, Starkey
Four
And now
did any other gentlemen say mutiny
I'll
bring out that doodle-doo myself
Five
Something blew out the light
Something
What of Cecco
He's as dead as Jukes
They do say the surest sign a ship's
accurst is when there's one on board more than can be accounted for
I've heard
he always boards the pirate craft last.
Had he a tail, captain
They say
that when he comes
it's in the likeness of the wickedest man aboard
Had he a hook, captain
The ship's doomed
Lads
now here's a notion. Open the cabin door
and drive them in. Let them fight the doodle-doo for their lives. If
they kill him, we're so much the better; if he kills them, we're none
the worse
Now, listen
Hook or me this time
Lads
I've thought it out. There's a Jonah aboard
Ay
a man wi' a hook
No, lads, no, it's the girl. Never was luck on a pirate ship wi' a
woman on board. We'll right the ship when she's gone
It's
worth trying
Fling the girl overboard
There's none can save you now, missy
There's one
Who's that
Peter Pan the avenger
Cleave him to the brisket
Down, boys, and at them
Put up your swords, boys
this man is mine
So, Pan
this is all your doing
Ay, James Hook
it is all my doing
Proud and insolent youth
prepare to meet thy doom
Dark and sinister man
have at thee
Now
Pan, who and what art thou
I'm youth, I'm joy
I'm a little bird
that has broken out of the egg
To't again
In two minutes
the ship will be blown to pieces
Bad form
Seventeen
half-past one
Don't be silly; what do I matter? Do go back and
keep an eye on the children
Dash it all, here are those boys again
But, my dear madam, it is ten days till Thursday week; so that by
telling you what's what, we can save you ten days of unhappiness
Yes, but at what a cost! By depriving the children of ten minutes of
delight
Oh, if you look at it in that way
What other way is there in which to look at it
No, my own one, this is the place for me
Do come in the kennel
O Nana, I dreamt my dear ones had come back
Listen to them
it is very gratifying
Lots of little boys
There were several adults to-day
But if I had been a weak man
Good heavens, if I had been a
weak man
And, George
you are as full of remorse as ever,
aren't you
Full of remorse as ever, dearest! See my punishment: living in a
kennel
But it is punishment, isn't it, George? You are sure you are not
enjoying it
My love
Won't you play me to sleep
on the nursery piano
And shut
that window. I feel a draught
O George, never ask me to do that. The window must always be left open
for them, always, always
Quick Tink
close the window; bar it! That's right. Now
you and I must get away by the door; and when Wendy comes she will think
her mother has barred her out; and she will have to go back with me
It's Wendy's mother! She is a pretty lady, but not so pretty as
my mother. Her mouth is full of thimbles, but not so full as my mother's
was
Home, Sweet Home
Come back, Wendy, Wendy, Wendy
You will never see Wendy again, lady, for the window is barred
She wants me to unbar the window
but I won't, not I
She's awfully fond of Wendy
I'm fond of her too. We can't both have her,
lady
Oh, all right
Come on, Tink
we don't want any silly mothers
John
I think I have been
here before
Of course you have, you silly. There is your old bed
So it is
I say
the kennel
Perhaps Nana is inside it
Hullo
there's a man inside it
It's father
Let me see father
He is not so big as the pirate I killed
Surely
he used
not to sleep in the kennel
John
perhaps we don't remember the old life
as well as we thought we did
It is very careless of mother
not to
be here when we come back
It's mother
So it is
Then are you not really our mother, Wendy
Oh dear
it was quite time we came back
Let us creep in
and put our hands over her eyes
Let us all slip into our beds, and be there when she comes in, just as
if we had never been away
Mother
That's Wendy
Mother
That's John
Mother
That's Michael
George, George
I must say
that you don't do things by halves
Do you think
we should be too much of a handful, sir? Because, if so, we can go
away
Father
We could lie doubled up
I always cut their hair myself
George
I don't think he is a cypher
Do you think
he is a cypher, Curly
No, I don't. Do you think he is a cypher, Slightly
Rather not. Twin, what do you think
We'll fit in, sir
Then follow the leader
Mind you, I am not sure that
we have a drawing-room, but we pretend we have, and it's all the same.
Hoop la
Hoop la
Hullo, Wendy, good-bye
Oh dear, are you going away
Yes
You don't feel, Peter
that you would like to
say anything to my parents about a very sweet subject
No
About me, Peter
No
Would you send me to school
Yes
And then to an office
I suppose so
Soon I would be a man
Very soon
I don't want to go to school and learn solemn things
I don't want to be a man. O Wendy's mother, if I was to
wake up and feel there was a beard
Peter
I should love you in a beard
Keep back, lady, no one is going to catch me and make me a man
But where are you going to live
With Tink in the house we built for Wendy. The fairies are to put it
high up among the tree tops where they sleep at nights
How lovely
I thought all the fairies were dead
There are always a lot of young ones
because you see when a new baby laughs for the
first time a new fairy is born, and as there are always new babies there
are always new fairies. They live in nests on the tops of trees; and the
mauve ones are boys and the white ones are girls, and the blue ones are
just little sillies who are not sure what they are
I shall have such fun
It will be rather lonely in the evening
sitting by the
fire
I shall have Tink
Tink can't go a twentieth part of the way round
Sneaky tell-tale
It doesn't matter
O Peter, you know it matters
Well, then, come with me to the little house
May I, mummy
Certainly not. I have got you home again, and I mean to keep you
But he does so need a mother
So do you, my love
Oh, all right
You won't forget me, Peter, will you, before spring cleaning time
comes
Who is Captain Hook
Don't you remember
how you killed him and saved
all our lives
I forget them after I kill them
Who is Tinker Bell
O Peter
There are such a lot of them
I expect she is no more
Perhaps he is ill
You know he is never ill
Perhaps there
is no such person, Wendy
What do we see now
I don't think I see anything to-night
Yes, you do
you see when you were a little girl
That is a long time ago, sweetheart
Ah me, how time
flies
Does it fly
the way you flew when you were a
little girl
The way I flew? Do you know, Jane, I sometimes wonder whether I ever
did really fly
Yes, you did
The dear old days when I could fly
Why can't you fly now, mother
Because I am grown up, dearest. When people grow up they forget the
way
Why do they forget the way
Because they are no longer gay and innocent and heartless. It is only
the gay and innocent and heartless who can fly
What is gay and innocent and heartless? I do wish I were gay and
innocent and heartless
I do believe
that it is this nursery
I do believe it is
Go on
The foolish fellow
tried to stick it on with soap, and
when he could not he cried, and that woke me, and I sewed it on for
him
You have missed a bit
When you saw him sitting on the floor crying, what did
you say
I sat up in bed and I said, 'Boy, why are you crying
Yes, that was it
And then he flew us all away to the Neverland and the fairies and the
pirates and the redskins and the mermaids' lagoon, and the home under
the ground, and the little house
Yes! which did you like best of all
I think I liked the home under the ground best of all
Yes, so do I. What was the last thing Peter ever said to you
The last thing he ever said to me was, 'Just always be waiting for me,
and then some night you will hear me crowing
Yes
But, alas, he forgot all about me
What did his crow sound like
It was like this
No, it wasn't
it was like this
My darling, how can you know
I often hear it when I am sleeping
Ah yes, many girls hear it when they are sleeping, but I was the only
one who heard it awake
Lucky you
Hullo, Wendy
Hullo, Peter
Woman, Woman, let go of me
Hullo, where is John
John is not here now
Is Michael asleep
Yes
That is not Michael
Hullo, is it a new one
Yes
Boy or girl
Girl
Peter
are you expecting me to fly away with
you
Of course; that is why I have come
Have
you forgotten that this is spring cleaning time
I can't come
I have forgotten how to fly
I'll soon teach you again
O Peter, don't waste the fairy dust on me
What is it
I will turn up the light
and then you can see for
yourself
Don't turn up the light
What is it
I am old, Peter. I am ever so much more than twenty. I grew up long
ago
You promised not to
I couldn't help it. I am a married woman, Peter
No, you're not
Yes, and the little girl in the bed is my baby
No, she's not
Boy
why are you crying
Hullo
Hullo
My name is Peter Pan
Yes, I know
I came back for my mother
to take her to the
Neverland
Yes, I know
I have been waiting for you
She is my mother
He does so need a mother
Yes, I know
no one knows it so well
as I
Good-bye
No, no
It is just for spring cleaning time
he wants me always to
do his spring cleaning
If only I could go with you
You see you can't fly
