Flopsy Bunnies
One, two, three, four! five! six leetle rabbits
One, two, three, four, five, six leetle rabbits
Eh? What's that? What have they been spoiling now
One, two, three, four, five, six leetle fat rabbits
one, two, three
Don't you be silly; what do you mean, you silly old man
In the sack! one, two, three, four, five, six
Not fit to eat; but the skins will do fine to line my old cloak
Line your old cloak
I shall sell them and buy
myself baccy
Rabbit tobacco! I shall skin them and cut off their heads
done it a purpose
