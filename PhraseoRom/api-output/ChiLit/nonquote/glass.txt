One thing was certain, that the WHITE kitten had had nothing to do with
it:-- it was the black kitten's fault entirely. For the white kitten had
been having its face washed by the old cat for the last quarter of
an hour (and bearing it pretty well, considering); so you see that it
COULDN'T have had any hand in the mischief.

The way Dinah washed her children's faces was this: first she held the
poor thing down by its ear with one paw, and then with the other paw she
rubbed its face all over, the wrong way, beginning at the nose: and
just now, as I said, she was hard at work on the white kitten, which was
lying quite still and trying to purr -- no doubt feeling that it was all
meant for its good.

But the black kitten had been finished with earlier in the afternoon,
and so, while Alice was sitting curled up in a corner of the great
arm-chair, half talking to herself and half asleep, the kitten had been
having a grand game of romps with the ball of worsted Alice had been
trying to wind up, and had been rolling it up and down till it had all
come undone again; and there it was, spread over the hearth-rug, all
knots and tangles, with the kitten running after its own tail in the
middle
cried Alice, catching up the kitten, and
giving it a little kiss to make it understand that it was in disgrace
she added, looking reproachfully at the old
cat, and speaking in as cross a voice as she could manage -- and then she
scrambled back into the arm-chair, taking the kitten and the worsted
with her, and began winding up the ball again. But she didn't get on
very fast, as she was talking all the time, sometimes to the kitten, and
sometimes to herself. Kitty sat very demurely on her knee, pretending to
watch the progress of the winding, and now and then putting out one
paw and gently touching the ball, as if it would be glad to help, if it
might
Alice began
Here Alice wound two or three turns of the
worsted round the kitten's neck, just to see how it would look: this led
to a scramble, in which the ball rolled down upon the floor, and yards
and yards of it got unwound again
Alice went on as soon as they were
comfortably settled again
she
went on, holding up one finger
pretending that the kitten was speaking
she went on,
talking more to herself than the kitten
cried Alice, dropping the ball of worsted to clap
her hands
And here I wish I could tell you half the things Alice
used to say, beginning with her favourite phrase
She
had had quite a long argument with her sister only the day before -- all
because Alice had begun with
and
her sister, who liked being very exact, had argued that they couldn't,
because there were only two of them, and Alice had been reduced at last
to say
And once she had really frightened her old nurse by shouting suddenly in
her ear
But this is taking us away from Alice's speech to the kitten
And Alice got the Red Queen off the table, and set it
up before the kitten as a model for it to imitate: however, the thing
didn't succeed, principally, Alice said, because the kitten wouldn't
fold its arms properly. So, to punish it, she held it up to the
Looking-glass, that it might see how sulky it was
she added
She was up on the chimney-piece while she
said this, though she hardly knew how she had got there. And certainly
the glass WAS beginning to melt away, just like a bright silvery mist.

In another moment Alice was through the glass, and had jumped lightly
down into the Looking-glass room. The very first thing she did was
to look whether there was a fire in the fireplace, and she was quite
pleased to find that there was a real one, blazing away as brightly as
the one she had left behind
thought Alice
Then she began looking about, and noticed that what could be seen from
the old room was quite common and uninteresting, but that all the rest
was as different as possible. For instance, the pictures on the
wall next the fire seemed to be all alive, and the very clock on
the chimney-piece (you know you can only see the back of it in the
Looking-glass) had got the face of a little old man, and grinned at her
Alice thought to
herself, as she noticed several of the chessmen down in the hearth among
the cinders: but in another moment, with a little
of surprise, she
was down on her hands and knees watching them. The chessmen were walking
about, two and two
Alice said (in a whisper, for
fear of frightening them
she went on, as she
put her head closer down
Here something began squeaking on the table behind Alice, and made her
turn her head just in time to see one of the White Pawns roll over and
begin kicking: she watched it with great curiosity to see what would
happen next
the White Queen cried out as she rushed
past the King, so violently that she knocked him over among the cinders
and she began scrambling wildly
up the side of the fender
said the King, rubbing his nose, which had been
hurt by the fall. He had a right to be a LITTLE annoyed with the Queen,
for he was covered with ashes from head to foot.

Alice was very anxious to be of use, and, as the poor little Lily was
nearly screaming herself into a fit, she hastily picked up the Queen and
set her on the table by the side of her noisy little daughter.

The Queen gasped, and sat down: the rapid journey through the air had
quite taken away her breath and for a minute or two she could do nothing
but hug the little Lily in silence. As soon as she had recovered her
breath a little, she called out to the White King, who was sitting
sulkily among the ashes
said the King, looking up anxiously into the fire, as if
he thought that was the most likely place to find one
panted the Queen, who was still a little out of breath
Alice watched the White King as he slowly struggled up from bar to bar,
till at last she said
But the King
took no notice of the question: it was quite clear that he could neither
hear her nor see her.

So Alice picked him up very gently, and lifted him across more slowly
than she had lifted the Queen, that she mightn't take his breath away:
but, before she put him on the table, she thought she might as well dust
him a little, he was so covered with ashes.

She said afterwards that she had never seen in all her life such a face
as the King made, when he found himself held in the air by an invisible
hand, and being dusted: he was far too much astonished to cry out, but
his eyes and his mouth went on getting larger and larger, and rounder
and rounder, till her hand shook so with laughing that she nearly let
him drop upon the floor
she cried out, quite
forgetting that the King couldn't hear her
she
added, as she smoothed his hair, and set him upon the table near the
Queen.

The King immediately fell flat on his back, and lay perfectly still: and
Alice was a little alarmed at what she had done, and went round the room
to see if she could find any water to throw over him. However, she could
find nothing but a bottle of ink, and when she got back with it she
found he had recovered, and he and the Queen were talking together in a
frightened whisper -- so low, that Alice could hardly hear what they said.

The King was saying
To which the Queen replied
the King went on
the Queen said
Alice looked on with great interest as the King took an enormous
memorandum-book out of his pocket, and began writing. A sudden thought
struck her, and she took hold of the end of the pencil, which came some
way over his shoulder, and began writing for him.

The poor King looked puzzled and unhappy, and struggled with the pencil
for some time without saying anything; but Alice was too strong for him,
and at last he panted out
said the Queen, looking over the book (in which
Alice had put
There was a book lying near Alice on the table, and while she sat
watching the White King (for she was still a little anxious about him,
and had the ink all ready to throw over him, in case he fainted again),
she turned over the leaves, to find some part that she could read
she said to herself.

It was like this.

She puzzled over this for some time, but at last a bright thought struck
her
This was the poem that Alice read.


             JABBERWOCKY
He took his vorpal sword in hand:
      Long time the manxome foe he sought --
     So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
      And stood awhile in thought.

     And as in uffish thought he stood,
      The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
     Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
      And burbled as it came!

     One, two! One, two! And through and through
      The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
     He left it dead, and with its head
      He went galumphing back
He chortled in his joy
she said when she had finished it
You see she didn't like to confess, even
to herself, that she couldn't make it out at all
thought Alice, suddenly jumping up
She was out of the room in a moment, and ran down stairs -- or, at least,
it wasn't exactly running, but a new invention of hers for getting down
stairs quickly and easily, as Alice said to herself. She just kept the
tips of her fingers on the hand-rail, and floated gently down without
even touching the stairs with her feet; then she floated on through the
hall, and would have gone straight out at the door in the same way, if
she hadn't caught hold of the door-post. She was getting a little giddy
with so much floating in the air, and was rather glad to find herself
walking again in the natural way
said Alice to herself
after going a few yards along
the path, and turning several sharp corners
And so she did: wandering up and down, and trying turn after turn, but
always coming back to the house, do what she would. Indeed, once, when
she turned a corner rather more quickly than usual, she ran against it
before she could stop herself
Alice said, looking up at the house and
pretending it was arguing with her
So, resolutely turning her back upon the house, she set out once more
down the path, determined to keep straight on till she got to the hill.
For a few minutes all went on well, and she was just saying
when the path gave a sudden twist and shook
itself (as she described it afterwards), and the next moment she found
herself actually walking in at the door
she cried
However, there was the hill full in sight, so there was nothing to be
done but start again. This time she came upon a large flower-bed, with a
border of daisies, and a willow-tree growing in the middle
said Alice, addressing herself to one that was waving
gracefully about in the wind
said the Tiger-lily
Alice was so astonished that she could not speak for a minute: it quite
seemed to take her breath away. At length, as the Tiger-lily only went
on waving about, she spoke again, in a timid voice -- almost in a whisper
said the Tiger-lily
said the Rose
the Tiger-lily remarked
Alice didn't like being criticised, so she began asking questions
said the Rose
Alice asked
cried a Daisy
cried another Daisy, and here they all began
shouting together, till the air seemed quite full of little shrill
voices
cried the Tiger-lily, waving itself
passionately from side to side, and trembling with excitement
it panted, bending its quivering head towards
Alice
Alice said in a soothing tone, and stooping down to the
daisies, who were just beginning again, she whispered
There was silence in a moment, and several of the pink daisies turned
white
said the Tiger-lily
Alice said, hoping to get it
into a better temper by a compliment
said the Tiger-lily
Alice did so
she said
the Tiger-lily said
This sounded a very good reason, and Alice was quite pleased to know it
she said
the Rose said in a rather
severe tone
a Violet said, so suddenly,
that Alice quite jumped; for it hadn't spoken before
cried the Tiger-lily
Alice said, not
choosing to notice the Rose's last remark
said the Rose
said the Tiger-lily
Alice asked eagerly, for the thought crossed her mind
the Rose said
the Tiger-lily
interrupted
the Rose added kindly
Alice didn't like this idea at all: so, to change the subject, she asked
said the Rose
Alice asked with some curiosity
the Rose replied
cried the Larkspur
Alice looked round eagerly, and found that it was the Red Queen
was her first remark. She had indeed: when Alice
first found her in the ashes, she had been only three inches high -- and
here she was, half a head taller than Alice herself
said the Rose
said Alice, for, though the flowers were
interesting enough, she felt that it would be far grander to have a talk
with a real Queen
said the Rose
This sounded nonsense to Alice, so she said nothing, but set off at
once towards the Red Queen. To her surprise, she lost sight of her in a
moment, and found herself walking in at the front-door again.

A little provoked, she drew back, and after looking everywhere for the
queen (whom she spied out at last, a long way off), she thought she
would try the plan, this time, of walking in the opposite direction.

It succeeded beautifully. She had not been walking a minute before she
found herself face to face with the Red Queen, and full in sight of the
hill she had been so long aiming at
said the Red Queen
Alice attended to all these directions, and explained, as well as she
could, that she had lost her way
said the Queen
she
added in a kinder tone
Alice wondered a little at this, but she was too much in awe of the
Queen to disbelieve it
she thought to
herself
the Queen said, looking at her watch
said the Queen, patting her on the head, which Alice
didn't like at all
Alice didn't dare to argue the point, but went on
When you say "hill,"' the Queen interrupted
said Alice, surprised into contradicting her at last
The Red Queen shook her head
she said
Alice curtseyed again, as she was afraid from the Queen's tone that she
was a LITTLE offended: and they walked on in silence till they got to
the top of the little hill.

For some minutes Alice stood without speaking, looking out in all
directions over the country -- and a most curious country it was. There
were a number of tiny little brooks running straight across it from side
to side, and the ground between was divided up into squares by a number
of little green hedges, that reached from brook to brook
Alice said at
last
She added in a tone of delight, and her heart began to beat quick
with excitement as she went on
She glanced rather shyly at the real Queen as she said this, but her
companion only smiled pleasantly, and said
Just at this moment, somehow or
other, they began to run.

Alice never could quite make out, in thinking it over afterwards, how it
was that they began: all she remembers is, that they were running hand
in hand, and the Queen went so fast that it was all she could do to keep
up with her: and still the Queen kept crying
but Alice
felt she COULD NOT go faster, though she had not breath left to say so.

The most curious part of the thing was, that the trees and the other
things round them never changed their places at all: however fast they
went, they never seemed to pass anything
thought poor puzzled Alice. And the Queen seemed to
guess her thoughts, for she cried
Not that Alice had any idea of doing THAT. She felt as if she would
never be able to talk again, she was getting so much out of breath: and
still the Queen cried
and dragged her along
Alice managed to pant out at last
the Queen repeated
And they ran on for a time in silence, with the wind whistling
in Alice's ears, and almost blowing her hair off her head, she fancied
cried the Queen
And they went so fast
that at last they seemed to skim through the air, hardly touching the
ground with their feet, till suddenly, just as Alice was getting quite
exhausted, they stopped, and she found herself sitting on the ground,
breathless and giddy.

The Queen propped her up against a tree, and said kindly
Alice looked round her in great surprise
said the Queen
said Alice, still panting a little
said the Queen
said Alice
the Queen said good-naturedly, taking a little
box out of her pocket
Alice thought it would not be civil to say
though it wasn't at all
what she wanted. So she took it, and ate it as well as she could: and it
was VERY dry; and she thought she had never been so nearly choked in all
her life
said the Queen
And she took a ribbon out of her pocket, marked in
inches, and began measuring the ground, and sticking little pegs in here
and there
she said, putting in a peg to mark the
distance
said Alice
said the Queen.

Alice did not know what to say to this, but luckily the Queen did not
wait for an answer, but went on
She had got all the pegs put in by this time, and Alice looked on
with great interest as she returned to the tree, and then began slowly
walking down the row.

At the two-yard peg she faced round, and said
Alice faltered out
Alice got up and curtseyed, and sat down again.

At the next peg the Queen turned again, and this time she said
She did not wait for Alice
to curtsey this time, but walked on quickly to the next peg, where she
turned for a moment to say
and then hurried on to the last.

How it happened, Alice never knew, but exactly as she came to the last
peg, she was gone. Whether she vanished into the air, or whether she
ran quickly into the wood
thought Alice),
there was no way of guessing, but she was gone, and Alice began to
remember that she was a Pawn, and that it would soon be time for her to
move
Of course the first thing to do was to make a grand survey of the
country she was going to travel through
thought Alice, as she stood on tiptoe in hopes of
being able to see a little further
and for some time she stood silent, watching one of them that was
bustling about among the flowers, poking its proboscis into them
thought Alice.

However, this was anything but a regular bee: in fact it was an
elephant -- as Alice soon found out, though the idea quite took her breath
away at first
was her next
idea
she went on, checking herself just as
she was beginning to run down the hill, and trying to find some excuse
for turning shy so suddenly
here came the favourite little toss of the head
she said after a pause
So with this excuse she ran down the hill and jumped over the first of
the six little brooks
said the Guard, putting his head in at the window.
In a moment everybody was holding out a ticket: they were about the same
size as the people, and quite seemed to fill the carriage
the Guard went on, looking angrily
at Alice. And a great many voices all said together
thought Alice
Alice said in a frightened tone
And again the chorus of
voices went on
said the Guard
And once more the chorus of voices went on with
Alice thought to herself
The
voices didn't join in this time, as she hadn't spoken, but to her
great surprise, they all THOUGHT in chorus (I hope you understand what
THINKING IN CHORUS means -- for I must confess that _I_ don't
thought
Alice.

All this time the Guard was looking at her, first through a telescope,
then through a microscope, and then through an opera-glass. At last he
said
and shut up the window and went
away
said the gentleman sitting opposite to her (he was
dressed in white paper
A Goat, that was sitting next to the gentleman in white, shut his
eyes and said in a loud voice
There was a Beetle sitting next to the Goat (it was a very queer
carriage-full of passengers altogether), and, as the rule seemed to be
that they should all speak in turn, HE went on with
Alice couldn't see who was sitting beyond the Beetle, but a hoarse voice
spoke next
it said, and was obliged to leave off
Alice thought to herself. And an extremely
small voice, close to her ear, said
Then a very gentle voice in the distance said
And after that other voices went on
thought Alice), saying
and so on.

But the gentleman dressed in white paper leaned forwards and whispered
in her ear
Alice said rather impatiently
said the little voice close to her ear
said Alice, looking about in vain to see where the
voice came from
The little voice sighed deeply: it was VERY unhappy, evidently, and
Alice would have said something pitying to comfort it
she thought. But this was such a wonderfully
small sigh, that she wouldn't have heard it at all, if it hadn't come
QUITE close to her ear. The consequence of this was that it tickled her
ear very much, and quite took off her thoughts from the unhappiness of
the poor little creature
the little voice went on
Alice inquired a little anxiously. What she
really wanted to know was, whether it could sting or not, but she
thought this wouldn't be quite a civil question to ask
the little voice began, when it was drowned by
a shrill scream from the engine, and everybody jumped up in alarm, Alice
among the rest.

The Horse, who had put his head out of the window, quietly drew it in
and said
Everybody seemed
satisfied with this, though Alice felt a little nervous at the idea of
trains jumping at all
she said to herself. In another moment she felt
the carriage rise straight up into the air, and in her fright she caught
at the thing nearest to her hand, which happened to be the Goat's beard.

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

    *    *    *    *    *    *

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

But the beard seemed to melt away as she touched it, and she found
herself sitting quietly under a tree -- while the Gnat (for that was the
insect she had been talking to) was balancing itself on a twig just over
her head, and fanning her with its wings.

It certainly was a VERY large Gnat
Alice
thought. Still, she couldn't feel nervous with it, after they had been
talking together so long
the Gnat went on, as quietly as if
nothing had happened
Alice said
the Gnat
inquired
Alice explained
the Gnat remarked carelessly
the Gnat said
said Alice
the Gnat replied
Alice began, counting off the names on
her fingers
said the Gnat
Alice asked, with great curiosity
said the Gnat
Alice looked up at the Rocking-horse-fly with great interest, and made
up her mind that it must have been just repainted, it looked so bright
and sticky; and then she went on
said the Gnat
the Gnat replied
Alice went on, after she had taken
a good look at the insect with its head on fire, and had thought to
herself
said the Gnat (Alice drew her feet back in
some alarm
A new difficulty came into Alice's head
she suggested
Alice remarked thoughtfully
said the Gnat.

After this, Alice was silent for a minute or two, pondering. The Gnat
amused itself meanwhile by humming round and round her head: at last
it settled again and remarked
Alice said, a little anxiously
the Gnat went on in a careless tone
said Alice
the Gnat
remarked
Alice asked
But the Gnat only sighed deeply, while two large tears came rolling down
its cheeks
Alice said
Then came another of those melancholy little sighs, and this time the
poor Gnat really seemed to have sighed itself away, for, when Alice
looked up, there was nothing whatever to be seen on the twig, and, as
she was getting quite chilly with sitting still so long, she got up and
walked on.

She very soon came to an open field, with a wood on the other side of
it: it looked much darker than the last wood, and Alice felt a LITTLE
timid about going into it. However, on second thoughts, she made up her
mind to go on
she thought to herself,
and this was the only way to the Eighth Square
she said thoughtfully to herself, 'where
things have no names. I wonder what'll become of MY name when I go in?
I shouldn't like to lose it at all -- because they'd have to give me
another, and it would be almost certain to be an ugly one. But then
the fun would be trying to find the creature that had got my old
name! That's just like the advertisements, you know, when people lose
dogs --"ANSWERS TO THE NAME OF
HAD ON A BRASS COLLAR"-- just fancy
calling everything you met
till one of them answered! Only they
wouldn't answer at all, if they were wise.'

She was rambling on in this way when she reached the wood: it looked
very cool and shady
she
said as she stepped under the trees
she went on, rather surprised at not being able to
think of the word
putting her hand on the trunk of the tree
She stood silent for a minute, thinking: then she suddenly began again
But being determined
didn't help much, and all she could say, after a great deal of puzzling,
was
Just then a Fawn came wandering by: it looked at Alice with its large
gentle eyes, but didn't seem at all frightened
Alice said, as she held out her hand and tried to stroke it; but it only
started back a little, and then stood looking at her again
the Fawn said at last. Such a soft sweet
voice it had
thought poor Alice. She answered, rather sadly
it said
Alice thought, but nothing came of it
she said timidly
the Fawn said
So they walked on together though the wood, Alice with her arms clasped
lovingly round the soft neck of the Fawn, till they came out into
another open field, and here the Fawn gave a sudden bound into the air,
and shook itself free from Alice's arms
it cried out in a
voice of delight
A sudden look of
alarm came into its beautiful brown eyes, and in another moment it had
darted away at full speed.

Alice stood looking after it, almost ready to cry with vexation at
having lost her dear little fellow-traveller so suddenly
she said
It was not a very difficult question to answer, as there was only one
road through the wood, and the two finger-posts both pointed along it
Alice said to herself
But this did not seem likely to happen. She went on and on, a long way,
but wherever the road divided there were sure to be two finger-posts
pointing the same way, one marked 'TO TWEEDLEDUM'S HOUSE' and the other
said Alice at last
So she
wandered on, talking to herself as she went, till, on turning a sharp
corner, she came upon two fat little men, so suddenly that she could not
help starting back, but in another moment she recovered herself, feeling
sure that they must be
They were standing under a tree, each with an arm round the other's
neck, and Alice knew which was which in a moment, because one of them
had 'DUM' embroidered on his collar, and the other
she said to
herself.

They stood so still that she quite forgot they were alive, and she was
just looking round to see if the word "TWEEDLE" was written at the back
of each collar, when she was startled by a voice coming from the one
marked
he said
added the one marked
was all Alice could say; for the words of the
old song kept ringing through her head like the ticking of a clock, and
she could hardly help saying them out loud
said Tweedledum
continued Tweedledee
Alice said very politely
But the little men only looked at each other and grinned.

They looked so exactly like a couple of great schoolboys, that Alice
couldn't help pointing her finger at Tweedledum, and saying
Tweedledum cried out briskly, and shut his mouth up again with
a snap
said Alice, passing on to Tweedledee, though she felt quite
certain he would only shout out
and so he did
cried Tweedledum
And here the two brothers gave each
other a hug, and then they held out the two hands that were free, to
shake hands with her.

Alice did not like shaking hands with either of them first, for fear
of hurting the other one's feelings; so, as the best way out of the
difficulty, she took hold of both hands at once: the next moment they
were dancing round in a ring. This seemed quite natural (she remembered
afterwards), and she was not even surprised to hear music playing: it
seemed to come from the tree under which they were dancing, and it was
done (as well as she could make it out) by the branches rubbing one
across the other, like fiddles and fiddle-sticks
Alice said afterwards, when she was
telling her sister the history of all this
The other two dancers were fat, and very soon out of breath
Tweedledum panted out, and they left
off dancing as suddenly as they had begun: the music stopped at the same
moment.

Then they let go of Alice's hands, and stood looking at her for a
minute: there was a rather awkward pause, as Alice didn't know how to
begin a conversation with people she had just been dancing with
she said to herself
she said at last
said Tweedledum
added Tweedledee
Alice said doubtfully
said Tweedledee, looking round at
Tweedledum with great solemn eyes, and not noticing Alice's question
Tweedledum replied,
giving his brother an affectionate hug.

Tweedledee began instantly
Here Alice ventured to interrupt him
she said, as
politely as she could
Tweedledee smiled gently, and began again
said Alice
said Tweedledee
Alice said indignantly
said Tweedledum.

This was a puzzler. After a pause, Alice began
Here she checked herself in some alarm,
at hearing something that sounded to her like the puffing of a large
steam-engine in the wood near them, though she feared it was more likely
to be a wild beast
she
asked timidly
said Tweedledee
the brothers cried, and they each took one of
Alice's hands, and led her up to where the King was sleeping
said Tweedledum.

Alice couldn't say honestly that he was. He had a tall red night-cap on,
with a tassel, and he was lying crumpled up into a sort of untidy heap,
and snoring loud
as Tweedledum remarked
said Alice,
who was a very thoughtful little girl
said Tweedledee
Alice said
Tweedledee exclaimed, clapping his hands triumphantly
said Alice
Tweedledee retorted contemptuously
added Tweedledum
Alice exclaimed indignantly
Ditto' said Tweedledum.

'Ditto, ditto' cried Tweedledee.

He shouted this so loud that Alice couldn't help saying
said Tweedledum
said Alice and began to cry
Tweedledee remarked
Alice said -- half-laughing through her tears, it all
seemed so ridiculous
Tweedledum interrupted
in a tone of great contempt
Alice thought to herself
So she brushed away her tears, and went on as
cheerfully as she could
Tweedledum spread a large umbrella over himself and his brother, and
looked up into it
he said
said Tweedledee
thought Alice, and she was just going to say
'Good-night' and leave them, when Tweedledum sprang out from under the
umbrella and seized her by the wrist
he said, in a voice choking with passion, and
his eyes grew large and yellow all in a moment, as he pointed with a
trembling finger at a small white thing lying under the tree
Alice said, after a careful examination of the
little white thing
she added hastily,
thinking that he was frightened
cried Tweedledum, beginning to stamp about wildly and
tear his hair
Here he looked at Tweedledee,
who immediately sat down on the ground, and tried to hide himself under
the umbrella.

Alice laid her hand upon his arm, and said in a soothing tone
Tweedledum cried, in a greater fury than ever
and his
voice rose to a perfect scream.

All this time Tweedledee was trying his best to fold up the umbrella,
with himself in it: which was such an extraordinary thing to do, that it
quite took off Alice's attention from the angry brother. But he couldn't
quite succeed, and it ended in his rolling over, bundled up in the
umbrella, with only his head out: and there he lay, opening and shutting
his mouth and his large eyes
Alice thought
Tweedledum said in a calmer
tone
the other sulkily replied, as he crawled out of the
umbrella
So the two brothers went off hand-in-hand into the wood, and returned
in a minute with their arms full of things -- such as bolsters, blankets,
hearth-rugs, table-cloths, dish-covers and coal-scuttles
Tweedledum remarked
Alice said afterwards she had never seen such a fuss made about anything
in all her life -- the way those two bustled about -- and the quantity of
things they put on -- and the trouble they gave her in tying strings and
fastening buttons
she said to herself, as
she arranged a bolster round the neck of Tweedledee
as he said
he added very gravely
Alice laughed aloud: but she managed to turn it into a cough, for fear
of hurting his feelings
said Tweedledum, coming up to have his helmet
tied on. (He CALLED it a helmet, though it certainly looked much more
like a saucepan
Alice replied gently
he went on in a low voice
said Tweedledee, who had overheard the
remark
said Alice, thinking it a good
opportunity to make peace
said Tweedledum
Tweedledee looked at his watch, and said
said Tweedledum
the other said, rather sadly
he added
cried Tweedledum
Alice laughed
she said.

Tweedledum looked round him with a satisfied smile
he said
said Alice, still hoping to make them a LITTLE
ashamed of fighting for such a trifle
said Tweedledum
thought Alice
Tweedledum said to his brother
said Tweedledee.

It was getting dark so suddenly that Alice thought there must be a
thunderstorm coming on
she said
Tweedledum cried out in a shrill voice of alarm: and
the two brothers took to their heels and were out of sight in a moment.

Alice ran a little way into the wood, and stopped under a large tree
she thought
She caught the shawl as she spoke, and looked about for the owner: in
another moment the White Queen came running wildly through the wood,
with both arms stretched out wide, as if she were flying, and Alice very
civilly went to meet her with the shawl
Alice said, as she helped
her to put on her shawl again.

The White Queen only looked at her in a helpless frightened sort of way,
and kept repeating something in a whisper to herself that sounded like
and Alice felt that if there was
to be any conversation at all, she must manage it herself. So she began
rather timidly
The Queen said
Alice thought it would never do to have an argument at the very
beginning of their conversation, so she smiled and said
groaned the poor Queen
It would have been all the better, as it seemed to Alice, if she had got
some one else to dress her, she was so dreadfully untidy
Alice thought to herself
she added aloud
the Queen said, in a
melancholy voice
Alice
said, as she gently put it right for her
the Queen said with a sigh
Alice carefully released the brush, and did her best to get the hair
into order
she said, after altering
most of the pins
the Queen said
Alice couldn't help laughing, as she said
said the Queen
the Queen said
Alice objected
said the Queen
said Alice
the Queen said kindly
Alice repeated in great astonishment
Alice remarked
the Queen
remarked
Alice ventured to ask
the Queen replied in a
careless tone
she went on, sticking a large piece
of plaster on her finger as she spoke
said Alice
the Queen said, as she
bound the plaster round her finger with a bit of ribbon.

Alice felt there was no denying THAT
she said
said the Queen
said Alice
the Queen said
triumphantly
said Alice
the Queen said
Her voice went higher
with each
till it got quite to a squeak at last.

Alice was just beginning to say
when
the Queen began screaming so loud that she had to leave the sentence
unfinished
shouted the Queen, shaking her hand about as
if she wanted to shake it off
Her screams were so exactly like the whistle of a steam-engine, that
Alice had to hold both her hands over her ears
she said, as soon as there was a chance of making
herself heard
the Queen said
Alice asked, feeling very much inclined
to laugh
the poor Queen groaned out
As she said the words the brooch
flew open, and the Queen clutched wildly at it, and tried to clasp it
again
cried Alice
And she
caught at the brooch; but it was too late: the pin had slipped, and the
Queen had pricked her finger
she said to Alice with a
smile
Alice asked, holding her hands ready to
put over her ears again
said the Queen
By this time it was getting light
said Alice
the Queen said
Alice said in a melancholy voice; and
at the thought of her loneliness two large tears came rolling down her
cheeks
cried the poor Queen, wringing her hands in
despair
Alice could not help laughing at this, even in the midst of her tears
she asked
the Queen said with great decision
You needn't say "exactually,"' the Queen remarked
said Alice
the Queen said in a pitying tone
Alice laughed
she said
said the Queen
The brooch had come undone as she spoke, and a sudden gust of wind blew
the Queen's shawl across a little brook. The Queen spread out her arms
again, and went flying after it, and this time she succeeded in catching
it for herself
she cried in a triumphant tone
Alice said very politely, as
she crossed the little brook after the Queen
cried the Queen, her voice rising to a squeak as she
went on
The last
word ended in a long bleat, so like a sheep that Alice quite started.

She looked at the Queen, who seemed to have suddenly wrapped herself up
in wool. Alice rubbed her eyes, and looked again. She couldn't make out
what had happened at all. Was she in a shop? And was that really -- was it
really a SHEEP that was sitting on the other side of the counter? Rub as
she could, she could make nothing more of it: she was in a little dark
shop, leaning with her elbows on the counter, and opposite to her was
an old Sheep, sitting in an arm-chair knitting, and every now and then
leaving off to look at her through a great pair of spectacles
the Sheep said at last, looking up for a
moment from her knitting
Alice said, very gently
said the
Sheep
But these, as it happened, Alice had NOT got: so she contented herself
with turning round, looking at the shelves as she came to them.

The shop seemed to be full of all manner of curious things -- but the
oddest part of it all was, that whenever she looked hard at any shelf,
to make out exactly what it had on it, that particular shelf was always
quite empty: though the others round it were crowded as full as they
could hold
she said at last in a plaintive tone, after
she had spent a minute or so in vainly pursuing a large bright thing,
that looked sometimes like a doll and sometimes like a work-box, and was
always in the shelf next above the one she was looking at
she added, as a
sudden thought struck her
But even this plan failed: the 'thing' went through the ceiling as
quietly as possible, as if it were quite used to it
the Sheep said, as she took up another
pair of needles
She was now working with fourteen pairs at once, and Alice
couldn't help looking at her in great astonishment
the puzzled child thought to herself
the Sheep asked, handing her a pair of knitting-needles
as she spoke
Alice was
beginning to say, when suddenly the needles turned into oars in her
hands, and she found they were in a little boat, gliding along between
banks: so there was nothing for it but to do her best
cried the Sheep, as she took up another pair of needles.

This didn't sound like a remark that needed any answer, so Alice said
nothing, but pulled away. There was something very queer about the
water, she thought, as every now and then the oars got fast in it, and
would hardly come out again
the Sheep cried again, taking more needles
thought Alice
the Sheep cried angrily, taking up
quite a bunch of needles
said Alice
said the Sheep, sticking some of the needles
into her hair, as her hands were full
Alice asked at last, rather vexed
said the Sheep
This offended Alice a little, so there was no more conversation for a
minute or two, while the boat glided gently on, sometimes among beds of
weeds (which made the oars stick fast in the water, worse then ever),
and sometimes under trees, but always with the same tall river-banks
frowning over their heads
Alice cried in a sudden
transport of delight
You needn't say "please" to ME about
the Sheep said, without
looking up from her knitting: 'I didn't put 'em there, and I'm not going
to take
Alice pleaded
said the Sheep
So the boat was left to drift down the stream as it would, till it
glided gently in among the waving rushes. And then the little sleeves
were carefully rolled up, and the little arms were plunged in elbow-deep
to get the rushes a good long way down before breaking them off -- and for
a while Alice forgot all about the Sheep and the knitting, as she
bent over the side of the boat, with just the ends of her tangled hair
dipping into the water -- while with bright eager eyes she caught at one
bunch after another of the darling scented rushes
she said to herself
And it certainly DID
seem a little provoking
she
thought) that, though she managed to pick plenty of beautiful rushes as
the boat glided by, there was always a more lovely one that she couldn't
reach
she said at last, with a sigh at the
obstinacy of the rushes in growing so far off, as, with flushed cheeks
and dripping hair and hands, she scrambled back into her place, and
began to arrange her new-found treasures.

What mattered it to her just then that the rushes had begun to fade, and
to lose all their scent and beauty, from the very moment that she
picked them? Even real scented rushes, you know, last only a very little
while -- and these, being dream-rushes, melted away almost like snow, as
they lay in heaps at her feet -- but Alice hardly noticed this, there were
so many other curious things to think about.

They hadn't gone much farther before the blade of one of the oars got
fast in the water and WOULDN'T come out again (so Alice explained it
afterwards), and the consequence was that the handle of it caught her
under the chin, and, in spite of a series of little shrieks of
from poor Alice, it swept her straight off the seat, and down among
the heap of rushes.

However, she wasn't hurt, and was soon up again: the Sheep went on with
her knitting all the while, just as if nothing had happened
she remarked, as Alice got back into her place,
very much relieved to find herself still in the boat
Said Alice, peeping cautiously over the side
of the boat into the dark water
But the Sheep only
laughed scornfully, and went on with her knitting
said Alice
said the Sheep
Alice echoed in a tone that was half astonished and half
frightened -- for the oars, and the boat, and the river, had vanished all
in a moment, and she was back again in the little dark shop
she said timidly
the Sheep replied
Alice said in a surprised tone, taking
out her purse
said the Sheep
said Alice, as she put the money down on
the counter. For she thought to herself
The Sheep took the money, and put it away in a box: then she said
And so saying, she went off to the other end of the
shop, and set the egg upright on a shelf
thought Alice, as she groped her way
among the tables and chairs, for the shop was very dark towards the end
So she went on, wondering more and more at every step, as everything
turned into a tree the moment she came up to it, and she quite expected
the egg to do the same
However, the egg only got larger and larger, and more and more human:
when she had come within a few yards of it, she saw that it had eyes
and a nose and mouth; and when she had come close to it, she saw clearly
that it was HUMPTY DUMPTY himself
she said
to herself
It might have been written a hundred times, easily, on that enormous
face. Humpty Dumpty was sitting with his legs crossed, like a Turk, on
the top of a high wall -- such a narrow one that Alice quite wondered how
he could keep his balance -- and, as his eyes were steadily fixed in the
opposite direction, and he didn't take the least notice of her, she
thought he must be a stuffed figure after all
she said aloud, standing with her
hands ready to catch him, for she was every moment expecting him to
fall
Humpty Dumpty said after a long silence, looking
away from Alice as he spoke
Alice gently explained
she added, hoping to turn her remark
into a sort of a compliment
said Humpty Dumpty, looking away from her as usual
Alice didn't know what to say to this: it wasn't at all like
conversation, she thought, as he never said anything to HER; in fact,
his last remark was evidently addressed to a tree -- so she stood and
softly repeated to herself
she added, almost out
loud, forgetting that Humpty Dumpty would hear her
Humpty Dumpty
said, looking at her for the first time
Humpty Dumpty interrupted impatiently
Alice asked doubtfully
Humpty Dumpty said with a short laugh
said Alice, not wishing to begin an
argument
cried Humpty Dumpty
Alice went on, not
with any idea of making another riddle, but simply in her good-natured
anxiety for the queer creature
Humpty Dumpty growled out
Here he pursed up his lips and looked so solemn
and grand that Alice could hardly help laughing
he
went on
Alice interrupted, rather
unwisely
Humpty Dumpty cried, breaking into a
sudden passion
Alice said very gently
Humpty Dumpty said in
a calmer tone
And he grinned almost from ear to ear, as he
leant forwards (and as nearly as possible fell off the wall in doing so)
and offered Alice his hand. She watched him a little anxiously as she
took it
she thought
Humpty Dumpty went on
Alice said very politely
said Humpty Dumpty
thought Alice
Alice made a short calculation, and said
Humpty Dumpty exclaimed triumphantly
Alice explained
said Humpty Dumpty.

Alice didn't want to begin another argument, so she said nothing
Humpty Dumpty repeated thoughtfully
Alice said indignantly
the other inquired.

Alice felt even more indignant at this suggestion
she said
said Humpty Dumpty
Alice suddenly remarked.

(They had had quite enough of the subject of age, she thought: and if
they really were to take turns in choosing subjects, it was her turn
now
she corrected herself on second thoughts
she
added in dismay, for Humpty Dumpty looked thoroughly offended, and she
began to wish she hadn't chosen that subject
she
thought to herself
Evidently Humpty Dumpty was very angry, though he said nothing for a
minute or two. When he DID speak again, it was in a deep growl
he said at last
Alice said, in so humble a tone that
Humpty Dumpty relented
said Alice, quite pleased to find that she HAD chosen a
good subject, after all
Humpty Dumpty continued thoughtfully, as he crossed
one knee over the other and clasped his hands round it
Alice said with a puzzled air
said Humpty Dumpty
Alice considered a little
she said at
last
cried Humpty Dumpty
said Alice
Humpty Dumpty looked doubtful
he
said.

Alice couldn't help smiling as she took out her memorandum-book, and
worked the sum for him:


               365
                1
               ____

               364
               ___

Humpty Dumpty took the book, and looked at it carefully
he began
Alice interrupted
Humpty Dumpty said gaily, as she turned it round for
him
said Alice
Alice said.

Humpty Dumpty smiled contemptuously
Alice objected
Humpty Dumpty said in rather a scornful tone
said Alice
said Humpty Dumpty
Alice was too much puzzled to say anything, so after a minute Humpty
Dumpty began again
said Alice
said Humpty Dumpty, looking very
much pleased
Alice said in a thoughtful
tone
said Humpty Dumpty
said Alice. She was too much puzzled to make any other remark.

'Ah, you should see
Humpty
Dumpty went on, wagging his head gravely from side to side
Alice didn't venture to ask what he paid them with; and so you see I
can't tell YOU
said Alice
said Humpty Dumpty
This sounded very hopeful, so Alice repeated the first verse
Humpty Dumpty interrupted
said Alice
Alice remarked thoughtfully
said Humpty Dumpty
said
Alice, surprised at her own ingenuity
Alice added
said Alice
said Alice
said Humpty Dumpty, stretching out one of his
great hands
Alice hastily said, hoping to keep him
from beginning
he went on without noticing her remark
Alice felt that in that case she really OUGHT to listen to it, so she
sat down, and said 'Thank you' rather sadly.


     'In winter, when the fields are white,
     I sing this song for your delight --


only I don't sing it,' he added, as an explanation
said Alice
Humpty Dumpty remarked severely. Alice was silent
said Alice
said Alice
Humpty Dumpty said
said Alice
Humpty Dumpty replied
Humpty Dumpty raised his voice almost to a scream as he repeated this
verse, and Alice thought with a shudder
There was a long pause
Alice timidly asked
said Humpty Dumpty
This was rather sudden, Alice thought: but, after such a VERY strong
hint that she ought to be going, she felt that it would hardly be civil
to stay. So she got up, and held out her hand
she said as cheerfully as she could
Humpty Dumpty replied in
a discontented tone, giving her one of his fingers to shake
Alice remarked in a
thoughtful tone
said Humpty Dumpty
marking their places in the
air with this thumb
Alice objected. But Humpty Dumpty only shut his
eyes and said
Alice waited a minute to see if he would speak again, but as he never
opened his eyes or took any further notice of her, she said
once more, and, getting no answer to this, she quietly walked away:
but she couldn't help saying to herself as she went
she repeated this aloud, as it was a great comfort to
have such a long word to say
She never finished the sentence, for at this moment a heavy crash
shook the forest from end to end
The next moment soldiers came running through the wood, at first in twos
and threes, then ten or twenty together, and at last in such crowds that
they seemed to fill the whole forest. Alice got behind a tree, for fear
of being run over, and watched them go by.

She thought that in all her life she had never seen soldiers so
uncertain on their feet: they were always tripping over something or
other, and whenever one went down, several more always fell over him, so
that the ground was soon covered with little heaps of men.

Then came the horses. Having four feet, these managed rather better than
the foot-soldiers: but even THEY stumbled now and then; and it seemed
to be a regular rule that, whenever a horse stumbled the rider fell off
instantly. The confusion got worse every moment, and Alice was very glad
to get out of the wood into an open place, where she found the White
King seated on the ground, busily writing in his memorandum-book
the King cried in a tone of delight, on seeing
Alice
said Alice
the King
said, referring to his book
said Alice
the King remarked in a fretful tone
All this was lost on Alice, who was still looking intently along
the road, shading her eyes with one hand
she
exclaimed at last
For the messenger kept skipping up and down,
and wriggling like an eel, as he came along, with his great hands spread
out like fans on each side
said the King
He pronounced it so as to rhyme with
Alice couldn't help beginning
the King remarked simply, without the least idea
that he was joining in the game, while Alice was still hesitating for
the name of a town beginning with H
said Alice
said the King
said Alice
the King repeated impatiently
At this moment the Messenger arrived: he was far too much out of breath
to say a word, and could only wave his hands about, and make the most
fearful faces at the poor King
the King said, introducing Alice
in the hope of turning off the Messenger's attention from himself -- but
it was no use -- the Anglo-Saxon attitudes only got more extraordinary
every moment, while the great eyes rolled wildly from side to side
said the King
On which the Messenger, to Alice's great amusement, opened a bag that
hung round his neck, and handed a sandwich to the King, who devoured it
greedily
said the King
the Messenger said, peeping into the
bag
the King murmured in a faint whisper.

Alice was glad to see that it revived him a good deal
he remarked to her, as he munched
away
Alice
suggested
the King replied
Which Alice did not venture to deny
the King went on, holding out his hand
to the Messenger for some more hay
said the Messenger
said the King
the Messenger said in a sulky tone
said the King
said the Messenger, putting his hands to his mouth
in the shape of a trumpet, and stooping so as to get close to the King's
ear. Alice was sorry for this, as she wanted to hear the news too.
However, instead of whispering, he simply shouted at the top of his
voice
cried the poor King, jumping up and
shaking himself
thought Alice
she ventured to ask
said the King
said the King
And they trotted
off, Alice repeating to herself, as she ran, the words of the old
song
she asked, as well as she
could, for the run was putting her quite out of breath
said the King
Alice panted out, after running a little
further
the King said
Alice had no more breath for talking, so they trotted on in silence,
till they came in sight of a great crowd, in the middle of which the
Lion and Unicorn were fighting. They were in such a cloud of dust, that
at first Alice could not make out which was which: but she soon managed
to distinguish the Unicorn by his horn.

They placed themselves close to where Hatta, the other messenger, was
standing watching the fight, with a cup of tea in one hand and a piece
of bread-and-butter in the other
Haigha whispered to Alice
he went on, putting his arm affectionately round
Hatta's neck.

Hatta looked round and nodded, and went on with his bread and butter
said Haigha.

Hatta looked round once more, and this time a tear or two trickled down
his cheek: but not a word would he say
Haigha cried impatiently. But Hatta only munched
away, and drank some more tea
cried the King
Hatta made a desperate effort, and swallowed a large piece of
bread-and-butter
he said in a choking
voice
Alice
ventured to remark.

'It's waiting for
said Hatta
There was a pause in the fight just then, and the Lion and the Unicorn
sat down, panting, while the King called out
Haigha and Hatta set to work at once, carrying rough
trays of white and brown bread. Alice took a piece to taste, but it was
VERY dry
the King said to Hatta
And Hatta went bounding away like a
grasshopper.

For a minute or two Alice stood silent, watching him. Suddenly she
brightened up
she cried, pointing eagerly
the King said, without even
looking round
Alice asked, very much
surprised at his taking it so quietly
said the King
he repeated softly to
himself, as he opened his memorandum-book
At this moment the Unicorn sauntered by them, with his hands in his
pockets
he said to the King, just
glancing at him as he passed
the King replied, rather nervously
the Unicorn said carelessly, and he was going
on, when his eye happened to fall upon Alice: he turned round rather
instantly, and stood for some time looking at her with an air of the
deepest disgust
he said at last
Haigha replied eagerly, coming in front of Alice
to introduce her, and spreading out both his hands towards her in an
Anglo-Saxon attitude
said the Unicorn
said Haigha, solemnly.

The Unicorn looked dreamily at Alice, and said
Alice could not help her lips curling up into a smile as she began
said the Unicorn
said Alice
the Unicorn went on, turning
from her to the King
the King muttered, and beckoned to Haigha
he whispered
Haigha took a large cake out of the bag, and gave it to Alice to hold,
while he got out a dish and carving-knife. How they all came out of it
Alice couldn't guess. It was just like a conjuring-trick, she thought.

The Lion had joined them while this was going on: he looked very
tired and sleepy, and his eyes were half shut
he said,
blinking lazily at Alice, and speaking in a deep hollow tone that
sounded like the tolling of a great bell
the Unicorn cried eagerly
The Lion looked at Alice wearily
he said, yawning at every other word
the Unicorn cried out, before Alice could
reply
the Lion said, lying down and
putting his chin on his paws
to the King
and the Unicorn
The King was evidently very uncomfortable at having to sit down between
the two great creatures; but there was no other place for him
the Unicorn said,
looking slyly up at the crown, which the poor King was nearly shaking
off his head, he trembled so much
said the Lion
said the Unicorn
the Lion replied
angrily, half getting up as he spoke.

Here the King interrupted, to prevent the quarrel going on: he was very
nervous, and his voice quite quivered
he
said
the Lion growled out as he lay down again
Alice had seated herself on the bank of a little brook, with the great
dish on her knees, and was sawing away diligently with the knife
she said, in reply to the Lion (she was getting quite
used to being called 'the Monster
the Unicorn
remarked
This sounded nonsense, but Alice very obediently got up, and carried the
dish round, and the cake divided itself into three pieces as she did so
said the Lion, as she returned to her place with the
empty dish
cried the Unicorn, as Alice sat with the knife
in her hand, very much puzzled how to begin
said the Lion
But before Alice could answer him, the drums began.

Where the noise came from, she couldn't make out: the air seemed full
of it, and it rang through and through her head till she felt quite
deafened. She started to her feet and sprang across the little brook in
her terror,

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

    *    *    *    *    *    *

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

and had just time to see the Lion and the Unicorn rise to their feet,
with angry looks at being interrupted in their feast, before she dropped
to her knees, and put her hands over her ears, vainly trying to shut out
the dreadful uproar
she thought to herself
After a while the noise seemed gradually to die away, till all was dead
silence, and Alice lifted up her head in some alarm. There was no one
to be seen, and her first thought was that she must have been dreaming
about the Lion and the Unicorn and those queer Anglo-Saxon Messengers.
However, there was the great dish still lying at her feet, on which she
had tried to cut the plum-cake
she
said to herself
she went on in a rather complaining tone
At this moment her thoughts were interrupted by a loud shouting of
and a Knight dressed in crimson armour came
galloping down upon her, brandishing a great club. Just as he reached
her, the horse stopped suddenly
the Knight cried,
as he tumbled off his horse.

Startled as she was, Alice was more frightened for him than for herself
at the moment, and watched him with some anxiety as he mounted again.
As soon as he was comfortably in the saddle, he began once more
but here another voice broke in
and Alice
looked round in some surprise for the new enemy.

This time it was a White Knight. He drew up at Alice's side, and tumbled
off his horse just as the Red Knight had done: then he got on again,
and the two Knights sat and looked at each other for some time without
speaking. Alice looked from one to the other in some bewilderment
the Red Knight said at last
the White Knight replied
said the Red Knight, as he took up
his helmet (which hung from the saddle, and was something the shape of a
horse's head), and put it on
the White Knight
remarked, putting on his helmet too
said the Red Knight, and they began banging away at each
other with such fury that Alice got behind a tree to be out of the way
of the blows
she said to herself, as
she watched the fight, timidly peeping out from her hiding-place
Another Rule of Battle, that Alice had not noticed, seemed to be that
they always fell on their heads, and the battle ended with their both
falling off in this way, side by side: when they got up again, they
shook hands, and then the Red Knight mounted and galloped off
said the White Knight, as he
came up panting
Alice said doubtfully
said the White
Knight
said Alice
It was evidently more than he could manage by himself; however,
she managed to shake him out of it at last
said the Knight, putting back his
shaggy hair with both hands, and turning his gentle face and large mild
eyes to Alice. She thought she had never seen such a strange-looking
soldier in all her life.

He was dressed in tin armour, which seemed to fit him very badly, and
he had a queer-shaped little deal box fastened across his shoulder,
upside-down, and with the lid hanging open. Alice looked at it with
great curiosity
the Knight said in a friendly
tone
Alice gently remarked
the Knight said, a shade of vexation passing over
his face
He unfastened it as he spoke, and was just going to
throw it into the bushes, when a sudden thought seemed to strike him,
and he hung it carefully on a tree
he
said to Alice.

Alice shook her head
said Alice
the Knight said in a discontented
tone
said Alice
said the Knight
he went on after a pause
Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity
the Knight replied
said Alice
the Knight said
This took a very long time to manage, though Alice held the bag open
very carefully, because the Knight was so VERY awkward in putting in
the dish: the first two or three times that he tried he fell in himself
instead
he said, as they got it in
a last
And he hung it
to the saddle, which was already loaded with bunches of carrots, and
fire-irons, and many other things
he continued, as they
set off
Alice said, smiling
he said, anxiously
Alice enquired
said the Knight
said the Knight
It didn't sound a comfortable plan, Alice thought, and for a few minutes
she walked on in silence, puzzling over the idea, and every now and then
stopping to help the poor Knight, who certainly was NOT a good rider.

Whenever the horse stopped (which it did very often), he fell off in
front; and whenever it went on again (which it generally did rather
suddenly), he fell off behind. Otherwise he kept on pretty well, except
that he had a habit of now and then falling off sideways; and as he
generally did this on the side on which Alice was walking, she soon
found that it was the best plan not to walk QUITE close to the horse
she ventured to
say, as she was helping him up from his fifth tumble.

The Knight looked very much surprised, and a little offended at the
remark
he asked, as he scrambled back into
the saddle, keeping hold of Alice's hair with one hand, to save himself
from falling over on the other side
the Knight said very gravely
Alice could think of nothing better to say than
but she said
it as heartily as she could. They went on a little way in silence after
this, the Knight with his eyes shut, muttering to himself, and Alice
watching anxiously for the next tumble
the Knight suddenly began in a loud voice,
waving his right arm as he spoke
Here the sentence ended
as suddenly as it had begun, as the Knight fell heavily on the top of
his head exactly in the path where Alice was walking. She was quite
frightened this time, and said in an anxious tone, as she picked him up
the Knight said, as if he didn't mind breaking two
or three of them
He let go the bridle, and stretched out both his arms to show Alice
what he meant, and this time he fell flat on his back, right under the
horse's feet
he went on repeating, all the time that Alice was
getting him on his feet again
cried Alice, losing all her patience this time
the Knight asked in a tone of great
interest, clasping his arms round the horse's neck as he spoke, just in
time to save himself from tumbling off again
Alice said, with a little scream
of laughter, in spite of all she could do to prevent it
the Knight said thoughtfully to himself
There was a short silence after this, and then the Knight went on again
said Alice
Alice said politely
said the Knight
Alice said
thoughtfully
the Knight said, gravely
He looked so vexed at the idea, that Alice changed the subject hastily
she said cheerfully
The Knight looked down proudly at his helmet, which hung from the
saddle
he said
The knight looked so solemn about it that Alice did not dare to laugh
she said in a trembling voice
the Knight said, very seriously
Alice objected.

The Knight shook his head
he said. He raised his hands in some excitement as he said
this, and instantly rolled out of the saddle, and fell headlong into a
deep ditch.

Alice ran to the side of the ditch to look for him. She was rather
startled by the fall, as for some time he had kept on very well, and she
was afraid that he really WAS hurt this time. However, though she could
see nothing but the soles of his feet, she was much relieved to hear
that he was talking on in his usual tone
he repeated
Alice asked, as
she dragged him out by the feet, and laid him in a heap on the bank.

The Knight looked surprised at the question
he said
he went on after
a pause
said Alice
the Knight said in a slow thoughtful tone
the Knight repeated as before
he went on, holding his head down, and his voice getting
lower and lower
Alice asked, hoping to cheer him
up, for the poor Knight seemed quite low-spirited about it
the Knight answered with a groan
he interrupted, quite eagerly
They had just
come to the end of the wood.

Alice could only look puzzled: she was thinking of the pudding
the Knight said in an anxious tone
Alice asked, for she had heard a good deal of poetry
that day
said the Knight
said Alice, for the Knight had made a sudden pause
EYES
Alice said, trying to feel
interested
the Knight said, looking a little vexed
Alice
corrected herself
said Alice, who was by this time
completely bewildered
the Knight said
So saying, he stopped his horse and let the reins fall on its neck:
then, slowly beating time with one hand, and with a faint smile lighting
up his gentle foolish face, as if he enjoyed the music of his song, he
began.

Of all the strange things that Alice saw in her journey Through The
Looking-Glass, this was the one that she always remembered most clearly.
Years afterwards she could bring the whole scene back again, as if it
had been only yesterday -- the mild blue eyes and kindly smile of the
Knight -- the setting sun gleaming through his hair, and shining on his
armour in a blaze of light that quite dazzled her -- the horse quietly
moving about, with the reins hanging loose on his neck, cropping the
grass at her feet -- and the black shadows of the forest behind -- all this
she took in like a picture, as, with one hand shading her eyes, she
leant against a tree, watching the strange pair, and listening, in a
half dream, to the melancholy music of the song
she said to herself
She stood and listened very attentively,
but no tears came into her eyes
As the Knight sang the last words of the ballad, he gathered up the
reins, and turned his horse's head along the road by which they had
come
he said
he added as Alice turned with an eager look in the
direction to which he pointed
said Alice
the Knight said doubtfully
So they shook hands, and then the Knight rode slowly away into the
forest
Alice said to
herself, as she stood watching him
So she went on talking to herself,
as she watched the horse walking leisurely along the road, and the
Knight tumbling off, first on one side and then on the other. After
the fourth or fifth tumble he reached the turn, and then she waved her
handkerchief to him, and waited till he was out of sight
she said, as she turned to run down the
hill
A very few steps brought her to the edge of the brook
she cried as she bounded across,

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

    *    *    *    *    *    *

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

and threw herself down to rest on a lawn as soft as moss, with little
flower-beds dotted about it here and there
she exclaimed in a tone of dismay,
as she put her hands up to something very heavy, and fitted tight all
round her head
she said to
herself, as she lifted it off, and set it on her lap to make out what it
could possibly be.

It was a golden crown
said Alice
she went on in
a severe tone (she was always rather fond of scolding herself
So she got up and walked about -- rather stiffly just at first, as she was
afraid that the crown might come off: but she comforted herself with the
thought that there was nobody to see her
she said as she sat down again
Everything was happening so oddly that she didn't feel a bit surprised
at finding the Red Queen and the White Queen sitting close to her, one
on each side: she would have liked very much to ask them how they came
there, but she feared it would not be quite civil. However, there would
be no harm, she thought, in asking if the game was over
she began, looking timidly at the Red Queen
The Queen sharply interrupted her
said Alice, who was always ready
for a little argument
cried the Queen
here she
broke off with a frown, and, after thinking for a minute, suddenly
changed the subject of the conversation
poor Alice pleaded in a piteous tone.

The two Queens looked at each other, and the Red Queen remarked, with a
little shudder
the White Queen moaned,
wringing her hands
the Red Queen said to Alice
Alice was beginning, but the Red Queen
interrupted her impatiently
Alice objected
said the Red Queen
said the White Queen
the Red Queen remarked; and then there was an
uncomfortable silence for a minute or two.

The Red Queen broke the silence by saying to the White Queen
The White Queen smiled feebly, and said
said Alice
the Red Queen remarked
said Alice
the White Queen asked
said Alice
the Red Queen interrupted
Alice replied very readily
said the White Queen
Alice was beginning, but the Red Queen answered for her
Alice considered
said the Red Queen
said the Red Queen
the Red Queen cried
Alice replied cautiously
the Queen
exclaimed triumphantly.

Alice said, as gravely as she could
But
she couldn't help thinking to herself
the Queens said together, with great
emphasis
Alice said, turning suddenly on the White Queen, for
she didn't like being found fault with so much.

The Queen gasped and shut her eyes
said the Red Queen
said Alice
the White Queen whispered
Here the Red Queen began again
she
said
Alice cried eagerly
the White Queen asked
Alice explained
said the White Queen
the Red Queen anxiously interrupted
So they set to work and fanned her with bunches
of leaves, till she had to beg them to leave off, it blew her hair about
so
said the Red Queen
Alice replied gravely
said the Red Queen.

Alice thought she saw a way out of the difficulty this time
she exclaimed triumphantly.

But the Red Queen drew herself up rather stiffly, and said
Alice thought to herself
the White Queen said in an anxious tone
Alice said very decidedly, for she felt quite
certain about this
she hastily corrected
herself
said the Red Queen
the White Queen said, looking down and nervously
clasping and unclasping her hands
Alice was puzzled
she remarked
The Red Queen said
Alice ventured to ask
cried the Red Queen
Alice sighed and gave it up
she thought
the White Queen went on in a low voice, more
as if she were talking to herself
said the Red Queen
the White Queen went on
Alice asked in an astonished tone
said the Queen
said Alice
Here the White Queen began again
said the Red Queen
Alice thought to herself
but she did not
say this aloud, for fear of hurting the poor Queen's feeling
the Red Queen said to Alice, taking
one of the White Queen's hands in her own, and gently stroking it
The White Queen looked timidly at Alice, who felt she OUGHT to say
something kind, but really couldn't think of anything at the moment
the Red Queen went on
But this was more than Alice had courage to do
The White Queen gave a deep sigh, and laid her head on Alice's shoulder
she moaned
said the Red Queen
said Alice, as she tried to obey the
first direction
said the Red Queen, and she began
she added, as she put her head down on
Alice's other shoulder
In another moment both Queens were fast asleep, and snoring loud
exclaimed Alice, looking about in great perplexity,
as first one round head, and then the other, rolled down from her
shoulder, and lay like a heavy lump in her lap
she went on in an impatient tone; but there was no answer
but a gentle snoring.

The snoring got more distinct every minute, and sounded more like a
tune: at last she could even make out the words, and she listened so
eagerly that, when the two great heads vanished from her lap, she hardly
missed them.

She was standing before an arched doorway over which were the words
QUEEN ALICE in large letters, and on each side of the arch there was a
bell-handle; one was marked
and the other
thought Alice
she went on, very much puzzled by
the names
Just then the door opened a little way, and a creature with a long beak
put its head out for a moment and said
and shut the door again with a bang.

Alice knocked and rang in vain for a long time, but at last, a very old
Frog, who was sitting under a tree, got up and hobbled slowly towards
her: he was dressed in bright yellow, and had enormous boots on
the Frog said in a deep hoarse whisper.

Alice turned round, ready to find fault with anybody
she began angrily
said the Frog.

Alice almost stamped with irritation at the slow drawl in which he
spoke
The Frog looked at the door with his large dull eyes for a minute:
then he went nearer and rubbed it with his thumb, as if he were trying
whether the paint would come off; then he looked at Alice
he said
He was so
hoarse that Alice could scarcely hear him
she said
the Frog went on
Alice said impatiently
the Frog muttered
Then he went up and gave the door a kick with one of his
great feet
he panted out, as he hobbled back to his
tree
At this moment the door was flung open, and a shrill voice was heard
singing
And hundreds of voices joined in the chorus
Then followed a confused noise of cheering, and Alice thought to
herself
In a minute there was silence again, and the same shrill
voice sang another verse;


  '"O Looking-Glass creatures," quoth Alice, "draw near!
  'Tis an honour to see me, a favour to hear
Then came the chorus again
Alice repeated in despair
and there was a dead silence the
moment she appeared.

Alice glanced nervously along the table, as she walked up the large
hall, and noticed that there were about fifty guests, of all kinds: some
were animals, some birds, and there were even a few flowers among them
she thought
There were three chairs at the head of the table; the Red and White
Queens had already taken two of them, but the middle one was empty.
Alice sat down in it, rather uncomfortable in the silence, and longing
for some one to speak.

At last the Red Queen began
she
said
And the waiters set a leg of mutton before
Alice, who looked at it rather anxiously, as she had never had to carve
a joint before
said the Red Queen
The leg of mutton
got up in the dish and made a little bow to Alice; and Alice returned
the bow, not knowing whether to be frightened or amused
she said, taking up the knife and fork, and
looking from one Queen to the other
the Red Queen said, very decidedly
And the
waiters carried it off, and brought a large plum-pudding in its place
Alice said rather
hastily
But the Red Queen looked sulky, and growled
and the waiters took it away so
quickly that Alice couldn't return its bow.

However, she didn't see why the Red Queen should be the only one to give
orders, so, as an experiment, she called out
and there it was again in a moment like a conjuring-trick. It
was so large that she couldn't help feeling a LITTLE shy with it, as she
had been with the mutton; however, she conquered her shyness by a great
effort and cut a slice and handed it to the Red Queen
said the Pudding
It spoke in a thick, suety sort of voice, and Alice hadn't a word to say
in reply: she could only sit and look at it and gasp
said the Red Queen
Alice began, a little frightened at finding that, the moment she opened
her lips, there was dead silence, and all eyes were fixed upon her
She spoke to the Red Queen, whose answer was a little wide of the mark
she said, very slowly and solemnly, putting her mouth
close to Alice's ear
the White Queen murmured
into Alice's other ear, in a voice like the cooing of a pigeon
Alice said very politely.

The White Queen laughed with delight, and stroked Alice's cheek. Then
she began
said the Red Queen
she screamed
at the top of her voice, and all the guests began drinking it directly,
and very queerly they managed it: some of them put their glasses upon
their heads like extinguishers, and drank all that trickled down their
faces -- others upset the decanters, and drank the wine as it ran off
the edges of the table -- and three of them (who looked like kangaroos)
scrambled into the dish of roast mutton, and began eagerly lapping up
the gravy
thought Alice
the Red Queen said,
frowning at Alice as she spoke
the White Queen whispered, as Alice got
up to do it, very obediently, but a little frightened
she whispered in reply
the Red Queen said very decidedly:
so Alice tried to submit to it with a good grace
she said afterwards, when she was telling her
sister the history of the feast
In fact it was rather difficult for her to keep in her place while she
made her speech: the two Queens pushed her so, one on each side, that
they nearly lifted her up into the air
Alice began: and she really DID rise as she spoke, several inches; but
she got hold of the edge of the table, and managed to pull herself down
again
screamed the White Queen, seizing Alice's hair
with both her hands
And then (as Alice afterwards described it) all sorts of things happened
in a moment. The candles all grew up to the ceiling, looking something
like a bed of rushes with fireworks at the top. As to the bottles, they
each took a pair of plates, which they hastily fitted on as wings, and
so, with forks for legs, went fluttering about in all directions
Alice thought to herself, as well as she
could in the dreadful confusion that was beginning.

At this moment she heard a hoarse laugh at her side, and turned to see
what was the matter with the White Queen; but, instead of the Queen,
there was the leg of mutton sitting in the chair
cried a
voice from the soup tureen, and Alice turned again, just in time to see
the Queen's broad good-natured face grinning at her for a moment over
the edge of the tureen, before she disappeared into the soup.

There was not a moment to be lost. Already several of the guests were
lying down in the dishes, and the soup ladle was walking up the table
towards Alice's chair, and beckoning to her impatiently to get out of
its way
she cried as she jumped up and seized
the table-cloth with both hands: one good pull, and plates, dishes,
guests, and candles came crashing down together in a heap on the floor
she went on, turning fiercely upon the Red Queen, whom
she considered as the cause of all the mischief -- but the Queen was no
longer at her side -- she had suddenly dwindled down to the size of a
little doll, and was now on the table, merrily running round and round
after her own shawl, which was trailing behind her.

At any other time, Alice would have felt surprised at this, but she was
far too much excited to be surprised at anything NOW
she repeated, catching hold of the little creature in the very act of
jumping over a bottle which had just lighted upon the table
She took her off the table as she spoke, and shook her backwards and
forwards with all her might.

The Red Queen made no resistance whatever; only her face grew very
small, and her eyes got large and green: and still, as Alice went on
shaking her, she kept on growing shorter -- and fatter -- and softer -- and
rounder -- and
and it really WAS a kitten, after all
Alice said, rubbing her eyes, and
addressing the kitten, respectfully, yet with some severity
It is a very inconvenient habit of kittens (Alice had once made the
remark) that, whatever you say to them, they ALWAYS purr
she had
said
On this occasion the kitten only purred: and it was impossible to guess
whether it meant 'yes' or
So Alice hunted among the chessmen on the table till she had found the
Red Queen: then she went down on her knees on the hearth-rug, and put
the kitten and the Queen to look at each other
she cried,
clapping her hands triumphantly
she said, when she was explaining the
thing afterwards to her sister
Alice cried with a merry laugh
And she caught it up and gave it one little kiss
she went on, looking over her shoulder at the White
Kitten, which was still patiently undergoing its toilet
she prattled on, as she settled
comfortably down, with one elbow in the rug, and her chin in her hand,
to watch the kittens
But the provoking kitten
only began on the other paw, and pretended it hadn't heard the question.

Which do YOU think it was?


              ----


         A boat beneath a sunny sky,
         Lingering onward dreamily
         In an evening of July --

         Children three that nestle near,
         Eager eye and willing ear,
         Pleased a simple tale to hear --

         Long has paled that sunny sky:
         Echoes fade and memories die.
         Autumn frosts have slain July.

         Still she haunts me, phantomwise,
         Alice moving under skies
         Never seen by waking eyes.

         Children yet, the tale to hear,
         Eager eye and willing ear,
         Lovingly shall nestle near.

         In a Wonderland they lie,
         Dreaming as the days go by,
         Dreaming as the summers die:

         Ever drifting down the stream --
         Lingering in the golden gleam --
         Life, what is it but a dream?


              THE END
