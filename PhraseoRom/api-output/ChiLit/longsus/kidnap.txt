a
costume referred to by one of the counsel as
wherein it is said that
he exclaimed; and the receipt for the
cries the carter, in so sharp a note that his very horse
started; and then
he continued,
as soon as he had ousted me from the stool and spoon
and when I had told him that she, too,
was dead
he said, looking wickedly at a corner of the
floor
said I, after I had thought the matter out in silence
and here he paused and stumbled
said he; and then, as I was going
said he, reviving a little
said I, with a jeering tone
resumed my uncle, as soon as he saw that I had done
said the poor moon-calf, changing his tune at once
says he, winking and looking very sly
to him I seemed old
said he, in a fine
deep voice
said Hoseason, with a sudden grimness
cried Mr. Riach, with a dreadful voice
he asked again; and when I had answered him
said the captain, still watching him
said the gentleman in the fine coat
and here he touched
his hat
said the captain; and then to myself
said I; and then, thinking that a man with so fine a
coat must like fine people, I added for the first time
he said, shaking his head
he cried in a kind of ecstasy
says he, falling again to smiling
he cried; and then, after a while
said he, wetting his lips
says he, and then he looked at the other men, as
much as to say
he said, striking right and
left, as if to make sure
cries he, and then with a leer
to leave the road and
lie in a bush if I saw any of the latter coming
says Glenure, musingly; and then to the lawyer
said I, a little nettled
said I, still with my face in the bracken
continued Alan, taking out his dirk and laying his hand upon
it in a certain manner
says I, willing to give him a little lesson
he added, putting his arm through mine
said James, returning to his former manner
says Alan, turning to me
said I to James, recovering from my little
fit of annoyance
and then looking at me with some
amusement
said I, surprised at his anxious and dark face
says he; and I was amazed at the clipping tones and
the odd sing-song in which he spoke, and no less at that strange trick
of dropping out the letter
Alan said to me on our first morning
what is called a hamlet
in the English
said I, drolling with him a little
says Alan,
drolling with me
said Alan, putting the purse in his pocket
said
Alan, and then to me
says I, quite cheerily; but I was thinking in to myself
says
he, pouring out the brandy
said he, meaning the collops
says he, cocking his hat
said I, looking at Alan
he cried, with a sudden heat of anger
said he, with rather a trembling voice
said I, in a voice that quivered like a fiddle-string
he added, his voice
tailing off in a laughable manner
said I, a little alarmed
said Alan, still addressing Robin, from whom indeed he had
not so much as shifted his eyes, nor yet Robin from him
laying a strong accent on the word
he said, when it was done
said Alan, with one of his droll looks
said Alan, softened a little (I believe against his will) by
this artless comment
says he, looking in his book
continued Mr. Rankeillor with a smile
said the lawyer, when I had quite done
says he, really with embarrassment
cried I, as soon as the clerk was gone
clapping me on the

said the
lawyer, stepping forward; and then mighty civilly
