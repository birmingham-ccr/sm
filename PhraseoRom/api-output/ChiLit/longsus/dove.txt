then, after a little pause, and some
reckoning
and, as the
master came forward, brushing from his furred vest the shavings and dust
of his work, she added in a more furtive, startled accent
replied Master Gottfried, in his cheery fearless voice
she trembled from head to foot, as she sank on her knees,
and murmured
as
he folded her in his rough arms
replied Hausfrau Johanna, in a marked tone
added her uncle, reassuringly
taking her hand
he added, looking down, and speaking in an under tone
said Gottfried, as the sweet face was
raised up to him with a look acquitting him of the charge, and he bent to
smooth back the silken hair, and kiss the ivory brow
said he, as he stumbled into the Stube
replied Gottfried; and Hugh, his
love of tormenting a little allayed by satisfaction in his buff suit, and
by an eye to a heavy purse that lay by his brother's hand on the table,
added
said Gottfried, who seldom invoked
the saints
he said in a low voice
said Hugh Sorel, as soon as he had placed her on
her mule, and led her out of hearing
pointing to a white
foamy thread that descended the opposite steeps
she heard Freiherr Eberhard return
he said, trying to
raise her head; and then, holding out one of her wasted, feverish hands
to Christina, he again asked, with a wistfulness that had a strange
effect from the large, tall man, almost ten years her elder
she said, but without thanks; and, feeling the
soft lambswool
he exclaimed, in amaze; then bethinking himself
exclaimed Ermentrude in the extremity of her amazement
replied Eberhard, clearing his voice with
difficulty
and, when the monk refused, with an inward
shudder at entrusting a sacred charge to such unhallowed hands, replied
He gathered her in his arms; he was quite past speaking;
and they only heard his heavy breathing, and one more whisper from
Ermentrude
pointing to
Eberhard and Christina
steadying her
voice with great difficulty
returned Christina with drooping, blushing
face
cried Christina, the
tears rushing into her eyes
as he saw her irrepressible
tears
she gasped with a sob
he said, as he saw how little those words served his cause
laughed the friar, changing his tone, and
holding up his finger slyly
explained Brother Peter, on receiving
this marriage fee
Christina tried to
murmur, but at that moment a sudden glow and glare of light broke out on
the eastern rock, illuminating the fast darkening little church with a
flickering glare, that made her start in terror as if the fires of heaven
were threatening this stolen marriage; but the friar and Eberhard both
exclaimed
quoth
Eberhard, as the old man picked himself up, looking horribly frightened
but this he scarcely heard, as he exclaimed
she said, trying to raise herself
implored Christina, by this time able
to rise and cross the room to the large carved chair; and Ursel
immediately turned to her underling, saying
was the first answer; then, as he
continued
returned the harsh voice, even harsher for very grief
said Christina, her eyes swimming in tears
replied Christina, with her blush deepening
and her soft eyes had a gleam of exultation, as she
looked at the two little mummies that made up the _us_
he said to Kunigunde, who had stood by all this time with
an anxious, uneasy, scowling expression on her face
he added, lowering his tone
cried Christina, her eyes brightening
but,
recalling herself in time, she feebly uttered the name she had longed
after from the moment she had known that two sons had been her Easter
gift
cried Ebbo, flying up to her
and the boy flung his arms round her neck, and
whispered in her ear
then, as
Christina uttered a faint cry of terror, Heinz added
said Friedmund, as if half ashamed
cried both boys, turning in horror
said Ebbo, with boyish lordliness
muttered the merchant, as he watched the two boys turn down
the pass
sighed Ebbo, as soon as he had hurried out of reach of the
temptation
said Ebbo, with perfect seriousness
said Ebbo, striding up to the scene of action
he added; and, standing in the middle of the hall, he took off his
cap, and spoke gravely
said Ebbo, sinking his voice
exclaimed Christina, amazed at the breadth of
visage and person
he continued, walking by her side
he answered, in an odd sort of apologetic tone
said Christina, wishing she could convey to him how
welcome he had been to marry any one he liked, as far as she was
concerned--he, in whom her fears of mincing goldsmiths had always taken
form--then signing with her hand
cried Christina, courting her fond embrace by
gestures of the most eager affection
said her uncle, after duly contemplating her
Ebbo forced himself to say
but a look into the grand benignity of the
countenance completed the conquest, and he turned it into
said Master Gottfried, with the
same kind dignity
whispered Ebbo to his brother; while
their mother, blushing, replied
said the old citizen, really displeased
interposed Friedel hastily, raising his sweet candid face with a
look between shame and merriment
he added, smiling to the youths
said Friedel to his brother
said Friedel, who had been watching the steps rather than
attending
said Wildschloss, rather more lightly than agreed
with the Baron's dignity
said Eberhard, turning
solemnly on him
she sobbed, in the lay sister's arms
and, receiving no response to this request, she
burst out
said her father, as she still resisted
added Friedel, after a breathless space
added Ebbo, perceiving his auditor's
interest
said the king, as after their dismissal he walked on with Sir
Kasimir
said Master Sorel, as he saw the brothers' grave, earnest
looks
readily answered Ebbo, in
Latin
as Friedel coloured deeper at
the sense that Ebbo was ashamed of him
cried Hausfrau Johanna with delight
said Christina, raising her eyes
said the old burgomaster with
displeasure
returned Gottfried in a conciliatory tone
said Christina, who had rallied a
little
said Ebbo, dashing his cap on the ground
murmured Ebbo to his brother, as the knight and lady seated
themselves in full view
said Ebbo, with flashing eyes, and low but resentful
voice
said the boy, standing in the middle of the floor as
his uncle returned
he added, half relenting as he looked at the
gallant, earnest face, full of defiance indeed, but with a certain
wistful appealing glance at
said Ebbo, with the same impulse
cried Ebbo, looking keenly
down
then went into another
musing fit, whence no one could rouse him to do more than say
said Friedel, glancing from the sparkling white slopes to the pure
blue above
and Friedel pointed to the thicket to the westward of the meadow
around the stream, where the beech trees were budding, but not yet
forming a full mass of verdure
and as his brother started
said Friedel, low and mysteriously
said the boy, coming nearer
cried Ebbo, but the boy seemed dumb
before him, and Friedel repeated the question ere he answered
responded Moritz; and, chafing with impatient fury, the knight
waited while Schlangenwald rode towards the old channel of the
Braunwasser, and there, drawing his rein, and sitting like a statue in
his stirrups, he could hear him shout
said the architect, who had turned with Friedel
said the count, speaking very slowly, and still holding the
young knight's gaze with a sort of intent fascination, by the stony glare
of his light gray eyes
and he was bending to take Ebbo's head again on his knee,
when a gush of dark blood, from his left side, caused Moritz to exclaim
cried Ebbo, supporting himself on his elbow,
so as to see his brother, who rather dreamily put his hand to his side,
and, looking at the fresh blood that immediately dyed it, said
he said, as he bent to assist in laying his brother on the
boards, where a mantle had been spread; then kissed his brow, saying
he added, as she came so near that he could put his
arm round her neck
as his face lighted up
said Friedel, raising her face to him
with his hand, and adding, as he met a startled look
he said, clasping his brother's hand
she said, entering, after a long interval
said Theurdank, kindly grasping his hand
muttered Theurdank, musing to himself
and, giving him little choice, Theurdank supported him
with one arm while removing the pillows that propped him, then laid him
tenderly down, saying
said Heinz, when by a sign he had intimated to her his
desire of speaking with her unobserved by the Baron
he said, with a peculiar smile
said Eberhard with a long breath, after having listened with a
hunter's keen interest to this hair's-breadth escape
he added aloud to himself
said Heinz, putting his hand on his
shoulder
said Ebbo, rallying his
forces
he added, taking Ebbo's hand
said a well-known voice
said Sir Kasimir, bending over him, and speaking in an
undertone
said the confused, surprised Ebbo
quoth Sir Dankwart, in a most serious tone
said Ebbo, for she wore a
little conventual dress
and, as she hid her face and clung to his mother, he added in a
more cheerful, coaxing tone
he added, stooping over Ebbo, and
kissing his brow
again she answered; and then, gathering courage
still eagerly pursued the pilgrim; and
receiving a sign in the affirmative
said the young
knight, springing off his horse
he cried, looking eagerly up to the pilgrim; but the man kept his
broad-leaved hat slouched over his face, and only muttered
the last word so low that Ebbo was not sure that he caught
it, and the next moment the old warrior exclaimed exultingly
said Ebbo, drawing the weapon, and
giving it to the old man, who held it for a few moments, weighed it
affectionately, and with a long low sigh restored it, saying
said Ebbo, with half a smile and half a blush
was the cry of poor Christina, almost beside herself
and, as his mother broke
from him, he fell upon his knee; but he only heard his father's cry
and he
took out a rosary of strung bladders of seaweed
said the traveller, holding up his hands in deprecation
said Ebbo, in his old defiant tone
said the
elder knight, looking round rather piteously; and Ebbo, with a sudden
movement, exclaimed
say Ebbo, after a moment's recollection, colouring as he spoke
said Heinz, looking from his old master to his
young one
said Sir Eberhard, rousing himself
mischievously to tell of
the direful yawns proceeding from brothers Ebbo and Gottfried over their
studies with their tutor, or to gaze from the window and wonder if the
father, with the two brothers, Friedel Max and Kasimir, will return from
Ulm in time for the
the guide shakes his head
