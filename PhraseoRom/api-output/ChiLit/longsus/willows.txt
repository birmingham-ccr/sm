cried the Rat, open-mouthed
cried the Mole in ecstacies
said the Mole suddenly, one bright summer morning
he cried, jumping up on seeing them
said the Rat, throwing himself into an
easy chair, while the Mole took another by the side of him and made some
civil remark about Toad's
he continued, as they descended the steps again
said the Rat slowly, as he chewed a straw
or stopped to say nice things about their beautiful cart; and rabbits,
sitting at their front doors in the hedgerows, held up their fore-paws,
and said
he added pathetically, in a lower
tone
he shouted, shaking both fists
he said to the
Mole, addressing him across Toad's head
said the good-natured Rat
he went on, going down on his knees to look
he said at last, slowly
said the Mole, quite pettishly
replied the Rat, really
angry
interrupted the Rat, rather unkindly
said a gruff and suspicious

he said

said the Badger, patting him on the shoulder
he called, full of joyful excitement

he said to himself as he marched along with his chin in the air
said one of the gentlemen
said Toad in a feeble voice
he
cried, in ecstasies of self-admiration
he gasped, as he panted along
said the Water Rat, gravely and firmly
and making strange suppressed
noises inside him, k-i-ck-ck-ck, and poop-p-p, and other sounds
resembling stifled snorts, or the opening of soda-water bottles, yet
when the Rat had quite finished, he heaved a deep sigh and said, very
nicely and humbly
shouted the Rat, thumping with his little
fist upon the table
said the Rat, slowly
and impressively
said the good-natured Rat, already appeased
said the Mole, moving towards the supper-table
said the Badger, with great severity
said the Badger, resuming his usual dry manner
said the Badger presently, looking at the
busy little animal over the edge of his newspaper
said the Badger, in his dry, quiet way
