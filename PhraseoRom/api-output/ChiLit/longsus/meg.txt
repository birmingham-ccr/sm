to ask Him to forgive me my
sins, and take me to heaven when I die -- wouldn't it, Meg
replied Meg, after some reflection
whispered Robin, pressing closer to her side
answered Meg, with a shrewd shake of her small
head
she said after a time, when they had come to a halt upon the
steps of a dwelling-house
said Meg, in a plaintive voice
ll laugh when
he comes home to-morrow; and maybe God laughs to us, only we can't see
His face
said Mr Grigg,
seizing it eagerly
said Meg, as he knelt at her knee, with his hands held up
between both her hands
ll give us good things, God
she answered, steadying her voice
cried little Meg, in an agony of distress
said Kitty's voice behind her
answered Meg, with a smile
replied Meg, looking
up tearfully into his good-tempered face
added Meg, taking Robin's bare and bleeding
foot into her hand
she said when Meg laid down her knife and fork, and assured
her earnestly that she could eat no more
continued Mrs Blossom, looking down
still upon the baby, as if she were telling her
If Robbie were ever so
naughty, I'd keep on loving him till he was good again
said Robin, after she had worn herself out with sobs and tears,
and was lying silently beside baby
gasped Meg, breathlessly, as she burst into the
shop, the shutters of which were already put up, though it was still
early in the night
answered Meg, with tearless eyes, for
her trouble was too great for tears
she cried, in a tone of piercing terror
exclaimed Mrs Blossom, pushing away Dr
Christie
answered Meg, in a low and cautious voice
said Dr Christie, rubbing his eyes
added Meg, in
a very tender tone
cried Kitty, almost crawling to the corner where she
lay, and falling down beside her on the floor, with her poor pale face
still hidden from sight
she said, after thinking for a minute
or two
ud do for me to ask God, if you didn't as
well
called little Meg from her mattress on the floor
she said at last, with a sigh as if her heart had well-nigh
broken
whispered Meg in his ear
said her father, turning it over
and over
said Fleming, with a deep sigh
said Fleming, shaking his head
said little Meg, in a tone of perfect confidence
