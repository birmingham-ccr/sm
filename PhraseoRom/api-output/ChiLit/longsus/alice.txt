for, you see, Alice had learnt several
things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this
was not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there
was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over
she was rather glad
there WAS no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all the
right word
for she had read several nice
little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild
beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not remember
the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot
poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your
finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never
forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked
said Alice to herself,
rather sharply
cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that
for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English
she might well say this
said poor Alice, and her eyes
filled with tears again as she went on
cried Alice, with a sudden burst
of tears
said Alice, a good deal frightened at the
sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence
said Alice in a soothing tone
Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the
pool
cried Alice in a sorrowful
tone
said the Mouse with an important air
said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely
the Mouse replied rather crossly
said Alice in a melancholy tone
said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet
said the Dodo in an offended tone
and they all crowded
round it, panting, and asking
said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger;
and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused
way
said Alice, looking down with wonder at
the Mouse's tail
sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite
out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her
daughter
and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to
its children
she added in a sorrowful
tone
then the Rabbit's voice along
then
silence, and then another confusion of voices
said the Rabbit's voice; and Alice called
out as loud as she could
she said to herself, and shouted out
said Alice to herself, as she wandered
about in the wood
said Alice, as she leant
against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the
leaves
Father William replied to his son
said the sage, as he shook his grey locks
repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone,
and added with a kind of sob
the Pigeon went on, without attending to her
continued the
Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek
said Alice, who was a very truthful
child
the Footman went on
without attending to her
said Alice, a little timidly, for she was
not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first
the Duchess said in a hoarse
growl
the Cat said, waving its right paw round
Alice said with some
severity
added the Dormouse, who seemed to be
talking in his sleep
the Hatter went on in a mournful tone
said the Hatter with a sigh
he said in a
hoarse, feeble voice
the Dormouse began
in a great hurry
Alice replied in an offended tone
and the Dormouse sulkily
remarked
the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing
its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy
said Alice, very much confused
said Five, in a sulky tone
said Alice, a little timidly
At this
moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called
out
said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to
Alice, she went on
said Alice very politely;
but she added, to herself
said Two, in a very humble tone, going
down on one knee as he spoke
Alice began, in rather a
complaining tone
Just then she noticed
that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on
said the King very decidedly, and he called
the Queen, who was passing at the moment
the Queen said to the executioner
she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful tone
though
she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of
rule
said the Duchess: 'and the moral of that is --"Oh, 'tis love
said the Duchess, digging her
sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she added
the Duchess said after a pause
said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to
everything that Alice said
exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last remark
shouted the Queen, stamping on the
ground as she spoke
thought Alice, as she went slowly
after it
she asked the Gryphon, and the
Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before
said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone
said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh
the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,
though still sobbing a little now and then
said the Mock Turtle
angrily
the Mock Turtle replied, counting off
the subjects on his flappers
the Mock Turtle said with a sigh
the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided
tone
but checked herself hastily, and
said 'No, never
the Mock Turtle went on
said Alice, feeling
very glad that it was over at last
here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes
the Gryphon went on in a deep voice
the Gryphon replied rather impatiently
said Alice, whose thoughts were still running
on the song
said
Alice a little timidly
said the Gryphon in an impatient tone
to the Caterpillar, and the
words all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath,
and said
Alice
replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone
cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun
to repeat it, when a cry of
she was obliged to say
you see, because some of them were
animals, and some were birds
the Gryphon whispered in reply
on their slates,
and she could even make out that one of them didn't know how to spell
said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three
blasts on the trumpet, and called out
the Hatter added as an explanation
the Hatter began, in a trembling voice
the King said, with a melancholy air, and,
after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were
nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice
said the King in a very grave voice
and read out from his book
said the White
Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry
said the
King, rubbing his hands
said Alice, (she had grown so large
in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit afraid of interrupting
him
he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them
with one eye
said the King, and he went on muttering over
the verses to himself
the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed
said Alice, and she told her
sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures
of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had
finished, her sister kissed her, and said
