she answered, shrugging her small shoulders to
draw her frock up higher about her neck
said the owner, in a cautious whisper
said the coffee-stall keeper very softly; and looking round to
see if there were any other ragged children within sight
he answered, hesitatingly, as if he was reluctant to tell so
much of himself
he exclaimed, harshly, as soon as he could recover his
presence of mind

she said, opening her Testament, and turning over the leaves
hurriedly
said Jane, in a sweet but grave manner
said Winny, looking round
encouragingly, as Jane tapped softly at the door, and they heard a

keep herself from crying
repeated Daniel, with unfeigned astonishment

her elbows firmly upon the arms of the chair, and planting her feet on
the floor

tenderness
