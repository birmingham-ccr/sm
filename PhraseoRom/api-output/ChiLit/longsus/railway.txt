said Phyllis, in
unenthusiastic tones
she said to
herself as she heard through the dark the catching of her Mother's
breath
cried Roberta, putting down her egg-spoon
Roberta and Peter exchanged guilty
glances
said Phyllis, smoothing out her pinafore
she whispered all to herself as she got into bed
said Peter,
passing his plate for more
said Roberta, drawing a long breath
said Bobbie; and Phil said
said Peter, keeping his own temper by what
looked exactly like a miracle
said Peter, rather touched by this devotion
said Bobbie and Phyllis, coming out of the shadow of another
truck labelled Staveley Colliery, and bearing on it the legend in white
chalk
said the Station Master, rubbing his chin thoughtfully
said Peter, in an offhand way,
and he pretended not to hear what Phyllis had said
he said in the hall to Bobbie
said she, when she had told all
said he, and produced a bunch of sweetbrier from his
hat
said Peter, with his hands in his pockets
said Phyllis, sniffing it loudly
said the Porter, whose name was Perks
cried Bobbie, quite overcome by this munificence
said Bobbie, much cheered to find herself addressed as
said Bobbie, firmly, though
her heart beat fiercely against her arm as she clasped her hands
said Bobbie, mentally registering the fact to tell the others
cried the engine-driver, suddenly
cried Peter, with a thrill of joyous excitement
said he, and turned, his hands still clasped in the hands of
the strange shabby figure, to throw a glance of triumph at the crowd
said the Station Master again
Mother said brightly, and she smiled
she said breathlessly when she came upon him
in his shirt sleeves, weeding his pansy-bed
was what the Doctor said
said Bobbie, with a sigh
Phyllis
flushed purple as she thought of the strawberries
said Peter, in awestruck tones
she stopped short, and then ended in quite
a different tone
when the children brought him
flowers, and
said Peter, his hands in his
pockets
said Bobbie, doubtfully, drying her hands on the rough
towel that hung on a roller at the back of the scullery door
he went on with a rush
said the old gentleman, pulling down the white waistcoat that
had the big gilt buttons on it
said Peter, when they were left on the platform, and the
tail-lights of the train disappeared round the corner
said the shout, in most disagreeable tones
said the Bargee, more gently
she cried in a terrible voice
said Peter, when they reached home very
happy, very tired, and very dirty
said Mrs. Ransome, sighing, and then laughing
said Mrs. Perks, with a beaming face
they heard Mr. Perks's voice say
she whispered to the others
said Bobbie, fumbling miserably, yet not without hope, in
her tightly stuffed pocket
said Perks, still with his back to them
he added,
suddenly wheeling the chair round and showing a very odd-looking
screwed-up face
said Mother, putting her arm round Bobbie and laying her ruffled
head against Bobbie's shoulder
said Mother, still leaning her head against her
said Bobbie, in a very little voice
said Phyllis, in a shocked tone
she used to say
comfortably
said Bobbie,
still trembling with fury
said Perks, regretfully, rubbing his ear with a black
and oily lump of cotton waste
she whispered, crushing the paper hard
said the voice of Phyllis
cried Mother, jumping up from the tea-tray
said Bobbie, and she telegraphed to her Mother
from her swollen eyes this brief, imploring message
Mother cried, when one little quick look had shown her
what it was
he added, turning to
Bobbie
cried Bobbie, bolting what was left
of her sandwich
said Phyllis, in a tone of exasperated triumph
said a voice through the blackness
were the words of the big signalman
when he had stopped crying
said Mother, with a worried frown
cried Bobbie, with a white face
he said, and he said it rather sternly
said the Doctor, though really he did not quite know
what to say
Bobbie whispered, leaning close to him as she
fumbled with the big knot under the settle
said Phyllis, with flaming cheeks
she
whispered as Peter picked up the basket and stalked out with it
said Phyllis, when peace was really restored, which was not
till they were washing up the cups after tea
he replied indignantly to Bobbie's scandalised
remarks
said Peter, even before he said
said the old gentleman, with a slight, swift glance at
Bobbie
said Mother, in a low voice to the old gentleman
said the old gentleman, taking both Mother's hands
said Peter, when all of them had thought and thought
till their heads felt quite heavy and swollen
said Bobbie, on this fourth day, which was a
Tuesday
Bobbie answered, a little breathlessly
said Bobbie to herself, and her heart quickened its beats
said Bobbie, stooping to stroke her
said Bobbie, as they
went up the road
