said a voice belonging to a servant who just then
opened the door
said Jeanne, rubbing her eyes
she repeated, as she ran across the tapestry room to the
uncurtained window
she called out, as
if the raven could have heard her so far off and through the closely
shut window
she cried, eagerly but respectfully
was all she could say
added Jeanne, after some consideration
said Jeanne's father, putting on his spectacles
as he took the letter from his wife
she
added, after a little silence
he added,
dropping his voice a little
repeated Jeanne, stopping half-way up the staircase to throw
her arms round Hugh's neck at the greatest risk to the equilibrium of
the whole party, including the guinea-pig
he added, as a sudden recollection struck him
said Hugh, after a minute's silence
she added, glancing round, and
seeing that Marcelline had left the room
she went on, in a lower voice
said Jeanne, flinging her arms round the old nurse's neck, and
giving her a kiss first on one cheek then on the other
pursued Jeanne after a few moments' silence, and a few

little cock to peck some crumbs out of her hand

said Jeanne, quite brightly again
said Jeanne, half out of breath
said Jeanne, a very little comforted

afterwards called them
seeing that Hugh was preparing to take up the oars
whispered Jeanne in a terrible fright

on the edge of the boat
he repeated, with a strange
solemnity
said Jeanne, after a short silence
he said to himself, as he climbed up into his
comfortable bed
she exclaimed, as the old nurse just then came into the
room

replied Hugh, looking at Jeanne reproachfully
said Jeanne, one evening, when they had been
