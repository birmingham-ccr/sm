said Anthea in a hurry
he seemed to say, as he looked at them from the back corner
of his eye
said Jane with a shudder
said the voice, rather louder but still
softly
said the Psammead, in a voice that sounded as though it would
begin to cry in a minute
said the Sand-fairy in trembling but
affectionate tones
said Jane, losing her head altogether
said the man with bitter politeness; 'I wish
you
he added, as the children disappeared
said the Psammead, sitting back on the sand and
shooting out its long eyes suddenly
said everybody; and Jane added
it said, when it had heard the news
it broke off to say
said Cyril; and Anthea said
the beautiful voice went on
she
added, remembering the beast's queer temper
said the Psammead in its friendly,
informal way
she said, looking lovingly at the bangle
said Robert, also assuming a boldness he was far from feeling
whispered Jane into the basket
said Cyril, in a low voice
said Cyril, with some dim remembrance of a dreadful day when
he had had to wait in an outer office while his father interviewed
a solicitor, and there had been nothing to read but the Daily
Telegraph
said the headman, turning suddenly and angrily on
Cyril
he pointed to the
hedged-in space
cried a harsh, strange voice
said Cyril, drawing a long breath
said Robert; but he added, with
a fine air of chivalry
said Robert, to
show that there was now no ill-feeling
he said, in that gentle, polite weary voice of his
he looked doubtfully at his audience and went
on
said Jane abruptly, and the others
hastened to say
said the learned gentleman, smiling rather sadly
whispered Cyril, in miserable derision
her voice sank to a whisper
he said, adding as an afterthought
said the gaoler, pointing to a heap of straw in a corner
cried Anthea; but Cyril cried
cried Cyril with great presence of mind
he said quickly, as the sound of her boots grew less loud
on the stairs
said the Psammead with withering irony
said Cyril, with a sigh of resignation
said the Psammead very crossly indeed
it said, sniffing a little contemptuously, yet at the same time
affectionately
cried Robert, and ran down the steps
said the marrow-selling woman
she remarked in an injured tone
the Queen went on pleasantly
she said, very loud and clear
whispered Anthea close to its bristling ear
a youth who had always been fair-haired broke that silence
bad tream,' said old Levinstein to his
clerk
said Anthea politely, following the sound of her
knock into the presence of the learned gentleman
he said, glancing at the bandages on the head of Cyril
and the hand of Robert
he added, forestalling the
question on Jane's lips
said Anthea,
with gentle politeness
he pointed to the learned gentleman
asked the Captain, fingering a rope
she added hastily, remembering the
Babylonian writing
said an old sailor who stood near
said Anthea as they went
said the
Captain, noticing the blundering walk of the learned gentleman
said Anthea timidly, when, very clean and boiled-looking, they
all met in the flowery courtyard of the Public
said Cyril, as he had been told
and she
looked down and saw the herd of bulls being driven out of the Temple by
whips, and the ten Kings following, one of them spurring with his
stick a black bull that writhed and fought in the grip of a lasso, she
answered the boy's agitated
said the Psammead later on
remarked Cyril pensively, as the flood of reminiscence ebbed a
little
said Anthea; and Jane added
she said in a furious whisper
said the
Psammead still more crossly
said the learned gentleman hopefully
said the learned gentleman to Jane, who hung back
she cried -- at least the word was more like that than any other
word
whispered the women who crowded round
said Jane with angry eagerness
said the Psammead sleepily, putting its head out
of its bag and taking it in again suddenly
he said, with brotherly concern
said Anthea, leaning her ear against his head
cried half the crowd; but another voice shouted
clear above the tumult
said the crimped-linen-dressed lady
asked a soft voice
behind them
said Cyril, taking the hint
he said to the children
said the voice of Pharaoh
said Anthea suddenly, and all eyes were
turned on her
said Anthea, struck by a sudden thought
said old Nurse, going round the table and putting the knives and
forks in their places
said Cyril, very slowly indeed
said Cyril, driven to greater clearness by the
blank faces of the other three
said Robert, remembering how impossible the Queen of Babylon had
found it to get anything out of the glass cases in the Museum -- except by
Psammead magic, and then she hadn't been able to take anything away with
her
said the child, jumping up
he added, as if apologizing
for this piece of information
said Anthea, looking out of the window
said the Psammead,
rather crossly
said Robert, in what was really a rather
annoying tone
cried Anthea, jumping up very quickly
said the Egyptian, bowing low, and that was even more
difficult than standing up
said old Nurse, carefully counting out the proper
number of shillings into Cyril's hand
said Mr Devant, rising to the occasion
said the Priest, deeply thoughtful
said Robert, breathing hard, and drawing the last knot
tight
cried Rekh-mara in fury
she took up the Amulet that
had swallowed the other one
she said in her kind little voice
said Rekh-mara, who had turned very white indeed under his
natural brownness
said the learned gentleman very earnestly
said the learned gentleman feverishly
he explained to the children
Rekh-mara was beginning, but Cyril and
Robert with one voice cried
she said almost in a whisper
said Jane in a queer voice
she pulled out the drawer as she spoke
said the beautiful, terrible
voice
she said, without at all meaning to say
it
said the Psammead -- its voice was crosser than they had ever heard
it
said Anthea, after a silence
said the learned gentleman, left alone
