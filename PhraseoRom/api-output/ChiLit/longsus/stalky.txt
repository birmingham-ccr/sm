Sergeant from the depths of his heart

the Head replaced the cane, and flung the written
charge into the waste-paper basket
the Slave of the
Lamp smiled politely
he explained in a loud voice over his soup
said the school chaplain slowly
said a mathematical
master hotly
Stalky curled his legs under him and addressed the
company
said Aladdin to the
Emperor of China
King was saying in a high head voice to Beetle, whom he had
kept to play with before Manders minor, well knowing that it hurts

Stalky rapped the
gilded book
said Stalky at last, sighting at a distant sparrow
with an attempt to imitate Stalky's war-voice
Stalky dropped unreservedly on Beetle's chest
the exquisite humor of it brought them sliding down
together in a tangle
Beetle began suavely as he loosened his braces
said Stalky at bedtime, making pilgrimage through the dormitories
before the prefects came by
Prout's juniors hurled themselves into
the war, and through the interval between first and second lesson some
fifty twelve-year-olds were embroiled on the gravel outside King's
