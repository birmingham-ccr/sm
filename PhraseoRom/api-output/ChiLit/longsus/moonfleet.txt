Ratsey said,
as he stepped back a pace to study the effect of a flag that he was
chiselling on the Revenue schooner
rejoined another man's voice that I did not
know
said a deep voice, and then I knew that Elzevir was
there too
said a voice that I thought was
Parmiter's, who lived at the bottom of the village
said Greening of Ringstave, for I knew his
slow drawl
says he, quite pert to Maskew
said the bailiff a little testily
and he raised
his hat
and while I went on counting, heard him repeating to himself,
though his words seemed thin and far off
and he unbuttoned his
pilot-coat
said he, as though
reflecting to himself
was the answer, and then the landlord caught
Elzevir by the hand, shaking it hard and saying
Elzevir said, turning to me

disappointment in his voice, however much he tried to hide it
says Mr. Aldobrand, his voice being not so
high as when he cried out last, but in his usual squeak; and then he
repeated
I said, swallowing the bitter disappointment which rose in my
throat
cries he, speaking to me in English
said one of the men at the table
and then he added, speaking to his comrade
he said, opening it
leisurely and smoothing it out upon his knee
he said, rising from his knees
