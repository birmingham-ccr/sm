began to burst from Etheldred's lips again, but was stifled
by Miss Winter's inquiry
valiantly exclaimed Tom; and while
threats were passing among the boys, Margaret asked, in a low voice
said Miss Winter; and
Ethel, seating herself on the corner of the window-seat, with one leg
doubled under her, took up a Shakespeare, holding it close to her
eyes, and her brother Norman, who, in age, came between her and Flora,
kneeling on one knee on the window-seat, and supporting himself with one
arm against the shutter, leaned over her, reading it too, disregarding a
tumultuous skirmish going on in that division of the family collectively
termed
namely, Harry, Mary, and Tom, until Tom was suddenly
pushed down, and tumbled over into Ethel's lap, thereby upsetting
her and Norman together, and there was a general downfall, and a loud
scream
said Mary, rushing among them, and bringing out a green
sphynx caterpillar on her finger
said Miss Winter in a
low voice to Flora, who shook her head, and said confidentially
said the
mother, while the impatient speech was repeated
said Ethel, bending her brow, with the fullness of her
thought
said the doctor, too intent on carving to perceive
certain deprecatory glances of caution cast at him by his wife, to
remind him of the presence of man and maid
He
broke off, for the noise subsided, and his speech was not intended for
the public ear, so he dashed into the general conversation, and catching
his own name, exclaimed
cried the indignant voice of Hector Ernescliffe, as his
honest Scottish face flushed like a turkey cock
he
answered, bounding off with an elasticity that caused his mother to say
the boy was made of india-rubber; and then putting his head in by the
window to say
said Ethel, running after him
the tears came into her eyes
said Margaret eagerly; and then, her colour deepening, as
she saw her mother looking at her, she said hastily
as Margaret looked
inclined to say something very eager
cried Ethel, flying into vehement activity
said Flora, tying the handkerchief
round Ethel's throat, and pulling out the fingers of her gloves, which,
of course, were inside out
and, as Flora went, he continued
said Ethel, crumpling
her work into a bundle, and snatching up her gloves; then, as they ran
downstairs, and emerged into the street
he added, looking exultingly at his sister
said Norman, in a low hopeless tone
said he affectionately, as he pressed his hand
said Flora, coming nearer, and almost gasping as she
whispered and signed towards the door
he said, in a soft weak tone:
then, as she bent down to kiss his brow
announced Harry, soon after they were released again
said Mr. Ward, turning and
proceeding to the dining-room
said Flora, and with a look that had more of
tenderness than grief, he murmured
said Ethel, when Flora took her again
and sighed heavily; then, as they stood round his bed,
unwilling to go, he added
and Blanche
climbed up to kiss him, saying
but
the doctor looked anxious and spoke low as he said
said Dr May more and more touched at the sight of
the young sailor struggling in vain to restrain his emotion
said Dr May, and as Alan hastily left the room, he
continued, half aloud, to himself
and over the balusters peeped a little rough curly head, a
face glowing with carnation deepened by sleep, and a round, plump, bare
arm and shoulder, and down at Alan's feet there fell a construction of
white and pink paper, while a voice lisped out
she added, drawing her down close
over her
said Margaret presently to
Flora
exclaimed Ethel; then seeing Richard shocked, and finding
she had spoken more vehemently than she intended
she said, holding
her close
said Ethel,
with a concluding sigh
said Ethel, a little shyly
stepping out to the door
said the lamentable Mrs. Taylor
and,
without perception of fit times and seasons, Ethel would have told her
story, but Margaret, too anxious to attend to her, said
cried Flora presently, jumping up
said Harry, twisting a little
said Harry, lowering his voice into an anxious
confidential tone
he said in his ear -- in a voice which
strong feeling had reduced to such a whisper, that even Margaret could
not hear -- she only saw how Harry, sobbing aloud, clung tighter and
tighter to him, till he said
said Harry, with the manly coolness that the sense of his
determination gave him
said his father, smiling kindly
and as he left the room,
his daughter again heard his sigh and half-uttered words
so Ethel condemned
Granny Hall as
said he, smiling sweetly in answer to the
children's earnest looks as they caught his meaning
and as he threw his arms round her neck, she whispered
at length he broke out
said Richard, in that tone which might be
either ironical or simple
said he, looking at his brother
sighed Ethel, nearly ready to cry
she said impatiently, and the hot tears breaking out
said Norman, whom these words roused to a
sense that he had been churlish last night
said Norman,
yawning and stretching
said Margaret, while Ethel gazed intently at her
father, wondering whether she ought to speak, for Margaret did not know
half what she did; nothing about the bad nights, nor what he called the
said Ethel, as her
father drew out her words, apparently with his eye
cried Ethel, in extreme distress
said his father, in a voice betraying much grief
said he, hardly able to speak
added Norman, hiding his face again
added Norman; and Mary
departed disconsolate, while Margaret gave a sigh of weariness, and
said, as she returned to her work
said Norman, after a few minutes
and he was turning back, but the doctor took
his arm, saying decidedly
said Norman, in a low voice
said she, only thinking of exalting her
generous brother
said Flora, the next Sunday, as
they joined each other in the walk from school to church
on discovering
the existence of the baby; and when Norman observed that was not so
atrocious either, she proceeded
said Richard, who had all the time been standing silent
said Ethel, with an odd shy manner
said the brother and sister
earnestly
and his voice was nearly inaudible
said the doctor, as the iron gates of ornamental scrollwork were
swung back
as Norman helped him off with his
plaid
said Meta, earnestly looking up
from the doctor; and then, as the
carriage disappeared, Mrs. Larpent exclaimed
was Mr. Wllmot's answer, while Ethel scrambled
in, and tried to make herself small, an art in which she was not very
successful; and Norman gave an exclamation of horrified warning, as she
was about to step into the flower-basket; then she nearly tumbled out
again in dismay, and was relieved to find herself safely wedged in,
without having done any harm, while her father called out to Mr. Wilmot,
as they started
she only made answer, in a very
grave voice
said Margaret, pausing; and then, with a sweet look, though a
heavy sigh, she said
said Flora, turning them over as they lay heaped on the
drawing-room sofa
said Richard; who, to her surprise, did not
look pleased or satisfied with the prosperous translation
said Tom, twisting his fingers, and gazing first at Ethel,
then at Harry, in hopes of being prompted, then at the ceiling and
floor, the while he drawled out the word with a whine
said Richard, in a gentle reasonable voice
and Una M'Carthy and her
little brother Fergus said something that nobody could make out, but
which Mr. Wilmot thought had once been an
said the doctor, as he saw his portmanteau locked, and
the key given to Norman
said Norman, as he knelt on the floor, and tumbled
miscellaneous articles out of his bag
said
Meta, clapping her hands
said Margaret; but Ethel continued, in a
piteous tone, a little sentimental
said Edward Anderson, shaking him by the ear
said Norman, as they were coming home from school one evening
said Norman, ready to shake it out of him
Norman took up the bottle, opened it, smelled,
and tasted, and was about to throw it into the river; when Tom
exclaimed
Ethel had once said to him
Ethel was exclaiming in delight
exclaimed his father, suddenly and angrily
said the doctor, in a voice not loud, but trembling
with anxiety; then laying his hand on his shoulder
and left Margaret to finish
put in Richard; and she continued
said Norman, anxious to turn from the real loss
and grief, as well as to talk away that feeling of being apologised to
said Norman, with some mortification
said Margaret, hesitating,
and feeling it her duty to say something
said Mr. Rivers, as his daughter came out of the school with
him, for, open and airy as it was, the numbers and the dinner made him
regard it as Norman had viewed the Cocksmoor room
added he, with a ridiculous confidential air
and it was only with a gulp and struggle that he
brought out the words
said Norman, recovering in the desire to reassure his
father
half muttered
the doctor; then, after long musing
said Norman, from the bottom of his heart
broke in the boy passionately
said Meta, with a sigh
said the doctor, unwillingly rising
at last
she added, finishing her lamentation, after
the others were out at the door
indignantly cried Ethel and Flora
cried Harry, passionately bursting open the study door
and, as something was said of going home
to the early dinner
said Flora, after putting her sister into the carriage
she added, in a low voice, as the tears came into her eyes
said Harry, imitating the gesture
cried Mary's voice in the first
pause, and, Margaret asking where he was, he suddenly turned round,
recollected himself, and found it was not the back of the chair that he
had been squeezing, blushed intensely, but made no attempt at apology,
for indeed he could not speak -- he only leaned down over Margaret, to
receive her heartfelt embrace; and, as he stood up again, his father
laid his hand on his shoulder
exclaimed Flora, opening the door
cried Ethel breathlessly; and,
perceiving the affirmative, added
implored Ethel, at the door
said Ethel, beginning to perceive the secret of her displeasure
cried he, as he glanced hastily over the letter
said Alan, turning to Margaret, as Ethel frantically
burst out of the room
said Margaret, who had been listening with a smile
and
Cherry wiped away a tear, and said
said Ethel, in vexation, though he gave her a pinch to show it
was all in good humour, while he went on
said Ethel, not in the least offended
said the doctor; but it surely
was not for that reason that he rose with so much alacrity and opened
the door, nor was
the greeting for his patients -- so
everybody sprang after him, and beheld something tall taking off a coat,
while a voice said
said Norman, carried along by the indignation and
tenderness that agitated his father's voice in his vehemence
whereupon Tom had
plunged into a thicket, and nearly
then, nettled by Margaret's laugh
cried Ethel, as she heard of this
cried each sister amazed; while Mary added
said Flora, who, however hurried, never failed in
kindness
cried Mary, running up to her, then slackening her pace, and
whispering
and then, growing clearer,
he proceeded
began Miss Rich, adhering to her as they parted
with the rest at the end of the street
said Flora, as the sisters turned homewards
she came near, and whispered
said Norman, in a low voice
cried her brother, laying hold of the child
added he, with a
drawl
said Meta, as if that were very different
said Meta, with a look of congratulation
she added, as she had now walked with him a little apart
as the colour rushed into his cheeks
said Norman, rather ashamed of the enthusiasm which, almost
approaching to the so-called "funny state" of his younger days, had
trembled in his voice, and kindled his eye
said Flora, looking down and hesitating
said he, laying his hand on her shoulder
he said, touched, but turning it off by a smile
he said, as if to himself
said Norman, considering; and, speaking very innocently
said he, after grumbling at the allotted ten
minutes
she said,
in her universal amity
he said, as she paused to open the MS
then, perceiving a knowing twinkle, as if he thought she
had made an admission, she added
for she grew rather ashamed of having
been impelled to utter the personal allusion
echoed Norman; but as if his thoughts were not quite with hers,
or rather in another part of the same subject; then recalling himself
said Norman; and yet he seemed
impelled to go on; for, after a hesitating silence, he added
said Meta, remembering the Sunday talk
said Ethel, glancing towards the paper
and he showed his son the paragraph, which Norman read as a
death warrant; the colour ebbed from his lips and cheeks; he trembled so
that he was obliged to sit down, and, without speaking, he kept his eyes
fixed on the words
added he, turning to Ethel
and there he broke off, paused for a minute, then
collecting himself, seemed resolutely to turn away from the subject, and
said, walking on
exclaimed Blanche, seizing on Ethel, and whispering
said Aubrey positively; for, as his father added
and he turned with a start of astonishment, and went into
a fit of laughing, re-echoed by all the young ones, who were especially
tickled by hearing, from another, the abbreviation that had, hitherto,
only lived in the favourite expletive
and Mary panted by her side,
humbly petitioning for the plantation path, when she answered
said Margaret that night, after they were in bed
and, as he heard a sound a little like
added the children, in chorus
harped on Mr. Rivers, dwelling on the subject,
as if he wanted to say something
said Meta, as they went back
He turned aside, and burst out
said
the doctor, almost overcome
said Margaret; and seeing
Ethel's anxious looks
and, at the same time, Adams
hurried up, as if he thought her being kidnapped, but his aspect changed
at the glad cry
as Harry's hand gave him
sensible proof
cried he, striding on, and dragging her in a
breathless run, as he threw open the well-known doors; and, she escaping
from him, hid her face in Mary's lap, screaming
said Ethel, while the brother was holding Mary in
his embrace, and she lay tremulous with the new ecstasy upon his
breast
she said, and when he had done so
said Ethel; then, seeing him disappointed, she came nearer,
and murmured
said Ethel, thinking him severe
and his tears fell fast over his book, as
he heard his father's
said little Gertrude, who had established herself on his knee
continued Harry's letter
to his father
cried Jennings, almost crying, and looking round for
Harry, as a sort of protector
said Norman, anxious to silence him
and he laughed heartily over that
adventure, ending, however, with a sigh, as he said
she answered, faltering; but perceiving how bright
were the looks of both
cried Harry, with a gesture of oppression
said
Meta, glancing at her deep mourning
But there she broke off, exclaiming
cried she,
as her husband stood astonished; and, springing towards him, she put
Harry's hand into his
slowly pronounced George, as he instinctively
gave the grasp of greeting
as the matter dawned fully on him, and he became eager
allowed himself
to be seated, and to be divested of a huge superfluous mass of sun-dried
curls, which Tom, particularly resenting that
said he, as they issued from the shop
cried a voice at his door
cried Harry, coming up to her
exclaimed Harry, bewitched by the beaming congratulation
of her look
said Ethel, half crying; then, as if unable to stay, she
exclaimed with a sort of petulance
began Meta; but, from the colour of
her cheek and the timid resolution of her tone, Flora thought it safest
not to hear the interrogation, and answered
said Margaret, holding up
a letter
then looking round the
room
said the doctor, as Flora would have
renewed the trial
and, when George
had borne her away, he kissed the lifeless cheek, and reverently placed
the little corpse in the cradle; but, as he rose from doing so, the
sobbing nurse exclaimed
then sitting up, and passing her hand over her eyes
said Flora presently, with a resolution of tone as if she would
prevent resistance
said the doctor at once; and she seemed grateful
not to be opposed, speaking more gently, as she said
he exclaimed, losing the calmness he had gained
by such an effort
she said,
pausing, as to recall her recollection
and the clear tone grew fainter than ever
with internal anguish, though still steady
said he, when he had seen the spiritualised
look of her glistening blue eyes, the flush on her transparent cheeks,
and her hands clasped over her breast
said the doctor, with a droll intonation
sighed Etheldred, as she fastened her white muslin
said Meta, in a low, heartfelt voice
he said, pausing, with a seriousness and hesitation that
startled her
they cried both at once, feeling that he was the
proper person in every way, and Norman added
Mr. Wilmot stood beside her, ere going to unrobe in the
school
the tears rose to
his eyes, and he brought out the words with difficulty
drawing back a little, and trying to
laugh off her feeling
she added, laughing, though
rather tearfully
as she drew Meta's arm into her own, and added
said Harry,
pulling him up by force
and her voice became
tremulous
as she advanced into the drawing-room
added Ethel, not able to leave off with such a
subject
explained Aubrey, unconscious that the
meaning was deeper than his sister could express, and he continued
she added, as
Flora complied; and she took her hand and fondled it
and, in explanation to the bishop
said the latter, as Hector's hand was on the door
she owned that
it had indeed been so, and added
began Norman, with lingering looks at
the little humming-bird on his arm
and
her dark eyes were steadfastly fixed
cried her sister, raising herself from her couch eagerly
said Ethel, a little startled
said Ethel, as she heard her affirmative
