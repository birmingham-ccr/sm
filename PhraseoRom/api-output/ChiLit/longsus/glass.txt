Alice went on as soon as they were
comfortably settled again
And here I wish I could tell you half the things Alice
used to say, beginning with her favourite phrase
and
her sister, who liked being very exact, had argued that they couldn't,
because there were only two of them, and Alice had been reduced at last
to say
Alice thought to
herself, as she noticed several of the chessmen down in the hearth among
the cinders: but in another moment, with a little
Alice said (in a whisper, for
fear of frightening them
she went on, as she
put her head closer down
said the Queen, looking over the book (in which
Alice had put
she said when she had finished it
thought Alice, suddenly jumping up
after going a few yards along
the path, and turning several sharp corners
said Alice, addressing herself to one that was waving
gracefully about in the wind
it panted, bending its quivering head towards
Alice
the Queen said, looking at her watch
said the Queen, patting her on the head, which Alice
didn't like at all
said Alice, surprised into contradicting her at last
said Alice, still panting a little
she said, putting in a peg to mark the
distance
and for some time she stood silent, watching one of them that was
bustling about among the flowers, poking its proboscis into them
here came the favourite little toss of the head
she said after a pause
Alice said in a frightened tone
said the gentleman sitting opposite to her (he was
dressed in white paper
said the little voice close to her ear
said Alice, looking about in vain to see where the
voice came from
the little voice went on
Alice went on, after she had taken
a good look at the insect with its head on fire, and had thought to
herself
said the Gnat (Alice drew her feet back in
some alarm
the Gnat went on in a careless tone
HAD ON A BRASS COLLAR"-- just fancy
calling everything you met
she
said as she stepped under the trees
it cried out in a
voice of delight
said Alice, passing on to Tweedledee, though she felt quite
certain he would only shout out
Alice said afterwards, when she was
telling her sister the history of all this
she said, as
politely as she could
Alice said -- half-laughing through her tears, it all
seemed so ridiculous
she added hastily,
thinking that he was frightened
the other sulkily replied, as he crawled out of the
umbrella
she said to herself, as
she arranged a bolster round the neck of Tweedledee
he went on in a low voice
the other said, rather sadly
Tweedledum said to his brother
Alice
said, as she gently put it right for her
she went on, sticking a large piece
of plaster on her finger as she spoke
the poor Queen groaned out
the Queen said with great decision
she added, as a
sudden thought struck her
the Sheep said, without
looking up from her knitting: 'I didn't put 'em there, and I'm not going
to take
Humpty Dumpty said after a long silence, looking
away from Alice as he spoke
said Humpty Dumpty, looking away from her as usual
Humpty Dumpty
said, looking at her for the first time
Humpty Dumpty said with a short laugh
she corrected herself on second thoughts
Humpty Dumpty continued thoughtfully, as he crossed
one knee over the other and clasped his hands round it
Humpty Dumpty said in rather a scornful tone
Humpty
Dumpty went on, wagging his head gravely from side to side
said Humpty Dumpty, stretching out one of his
great hands
he went on without noticing her remark
Humpty Dumpty replied in
a discontented tone, giving her one of his fingers to shake
marking their places in the
air with this thumb
once more, and, getting no answer to this, she quietly walked away:
but she couldn't help saying to herself as she went
she repeated this aloud, as it was a great comfort to
have such a long word to say
Alice panted out, after running a little
further
he said in a choking
voice
the King said to Hatta
to the King
and the Unicorn
she went on in a rather complaining tone
but here another voice broke in
she said to herself, as
she watched the fight, timidly peeping out from her hiding-place
the Knight said in a discontented
tone
he went on after a pause
he said, as they got it in
a last
the Knight said very gravely
the Knight suddenly began in a loud voice,
waving his right arm as he spoke
she said in a trembling voice
he went on after
a pause
the Knight said in a slow thoughtful tone
the Knight repeated as before
he went on, holding his head down, and his voice getting
lower and lower
the Knight said in an anxious tone
she said, as she turned to run down the
hill
she went on in
a severe tone (she was always rather fond of scolding herself
she said as she sat down again
said Alice, who was always ready
for a little argument
Alice said very decidedly, for she felt quite
certain about this
the White Queen said, looking down and nervously
clasping and unclasping her hands
the White Queen went on
the Red Queen said to Alice, taking
one of the White Queen's hands in her own, and gently stroking it
the Red Queen went on
said Alice, as she tried to obey the
first direction
she added, as she put her head down on
Alice's other shoulder
he panted out, as he hobbled back to his
tree
the Red Queen said, very decidedly
Alice began, a little frightened at finding that, the moment she opened
her lips, there was dead silence, and all eyes were fixed upon her
she said, very slowly and solemnly, putting her mouth
close to Alice's ear
she screamed
at the top of her voice, and all the guests began drinking it directly,
and very queerly they managed it: some of them put their glasses upon
their heads like extinguishers, and drank all that trickled down their
faces -- others upset the decanters, and drank the wine as it ran off
the edges of the table -- and three of them (who looked like kangaroos)
scrambled into the dish of roast mutton, and began eagerly lapping up
the gravy
In fact it was rather difficult for her to keep in her place while she
made her speech: the two Queens pushed her so, one on each side, that
they nearly lifted her up into the air
she repeated, catching hold of the little creature in the very act of
jumping over a bottle which had just lighted upon the table
she said, when she was explaining the
thing afterwards to her sister
she went on, looking over her shoulder at the White
Kitten, which was still patiently undergoing its toilet
