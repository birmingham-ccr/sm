I said by way of making a
remark
and he glanced at the
Wakwafi Askari
and here his face grew stern again
and he swung the formidable weapon round his head, making the
air hiss as he clove it
and I pointed to Sir Henry
I said, for I saw that he was getting the blood-fever on
him
and I
pointed to the Wakwafi, who had retired a little way during our 'indaba'
(talk
he said, giving the
terrified man a shake
and his long fingers
closed round his throat as he said it
went on Umslopogaas, in simulated fury, which a very
little provocation would have made real enough
he said, pointing
to the Tana River
holloaed Sir Henry from the other boat
ejaculated Good, after
surveying the trio through his eyeglass
said Mr Mackenzie, a grey-haired, angular man,
with a kindly face and red cheeks
said Mr Mackenzie, pointing to the ditch and wall
replied the little Frenchman, his eyes still fixed upon
Umslopogaas, whose general appearance seemed to fascinate him
said Sir Henry, after we had eaten a most excellent
dinner
said Sir Henry, who had been listening with breathless interest
she said, giving her head a little toss
and diving her little hand into the bodice of her dress
she produced a double-barrelled nickel-plated Derringer
she went on in an altered
voice, touching me on the arm and pointing to some far-away object
and here his manly voice broke into a sob
I said, a little anxiously
and he pointed to the head which lay upon the paving of the
stoep -- a ghastly sight in the moonlight
and he pointed
to Sir Henry, Good, and myself
he added
frankly, glancing at the wall
said Mackenzie, addressing the Lygonani
he added with a laugh
and he drew an oval on the floor
said Mr Mackenzie, after he had put all the circumstances of the
case fully and clearly before them, and explained to them the proposed
plan of our forlorn hope
he went on with added fervour
said the same deep voice, that belonged to
a stalwart elder of the Mission
began the clergyman, his deep voice, tremulous with
emotion, echoing up in the silence even to the leafy roof
he said, seeing me staring at his belt
I whispered
again, giving him the rag
he cried, in mockery, to the Elmoran
ejaculated Umslopogaas, contemplating the corpse of his foe
I said, for I did not feel amiable
he sang out in a trembling, excited voice
and then breaking
into broad Scotch and glancing at the bent knife in his hand
he said to me as I limped up, feeling very sick
she said, beginning to cry hysterically
she cried, throwing her
arms round my neck and bursting into tears
called out Good, who was on shore the first
she said in a quiet choked voice, and pointing at the fair but
unconscious disciple of Wackford Squeers
she said again in the same voice
I said, bowing low before Sorais
he said -- for my nerves were so much on the stretch that I
could hear every word, low as it was spoken, even through Sorais' divine
notes
she answered, looking fixedly before her
she said in a low voice
she went on with proud humility, and in the stately third
person which is so largely used by the Zu-Vendi
and she curtseyed towards him
and she lifted her broidered skirt and curtseyed
again
she added with a flash of passion
answered Sir Henry, adopting the Zu-Vendi way of speech
he said, restraining
himself with difficulty and looking anything but grateful
he added,
with a sneer
and at last neither I nor Sir Henry, whom I had summoned to
enjoy the sight, could stand it any longer; so, remembering the dear old
story, I put my head to the window opening, and shouted
he exclaimed, springing up in delight
he said, with a bitter little laugh
and she pointed
to Sir Henry with her toy spear
she said, when the excited murmur of the spectators had
died away, addressing her sister as Sir Henry rose to his feet
she went on, smiling sweetly on her lover,
and pointing to the golden snake she had twined round his massive
throat
she said in notes which pealed through
the great hall like a clarion
here
poor Good shook his head vigorously and ejaculated 'Can't be done' in
English
here there was an immense sensation in the
hall
she added, with a stamp of her
foot
pointing to the
entrance to a private chapel
answered Sir Henry; adding in English
said I, when I saw them
he gasped out in a voice that was nearly inarticulate
with fright
I said at the third of these stoppages
shouted the Zulu, as he recognized the priest's flowing white
beard
she said, turning to me and
laying her hand upon my shoulder, 'wot ye that, though wounded in the
fight of yesterday, he rode with that old warrior who lies there, one
hundred miles
he
added, with a change of tone
she said, with a little stamp of the foot
she answered, with a little laugh
she went on, pointing at
Alphonse with the silver spear, whereat he looked very uncomfortable
here Alphonse shivered at some unhappy recollection
stammered Curtis, looking at Good
he says, with an expressive
shrug
he gasped, with an attempt at a smile
he said, after gazing earnestly at it
