he
cried to the man who trundled the barrow
says the doctor; and when the ruffian had
told him, with another oath, that this was so
said she when I had done so
or a mere entry of latitude and longitude, as
said I, interrupting the letter
cried Silver; and
then, relinquishing my hand
said Long John very sternly
he ran on again,
aloud
began the doctor with a smile
he ran on, to the fellows who were shifting the powder; and
then suddenly observing me examining the swivel we carried amidships,
a long brass nine
answered Silver, shaking
hands so heartily that all the barrel shook
and Silver
himself saying, in a kind of song
said the captain, when all was sheeted home
he said with an oath
said the other man -- and I observed he was not only red in the
face, but spoke as hoarse as a crow, and his voice shook too, like a
taut rope
looking all round him and
lowering his voice to a whisper
says Captain Smollett, nodding towards him
resumed Mr. Smollett, a little louder
said the man Gray, who was sitting in
the fore-sheets
returned the captain, scratching his head
laying a particular emphasis upon the
word
returned the sea-cook, sitting down as he was
bidden on the sand
he began, nodding feebly at the corpse
said he at length with that same uncomfortable smile
he added,
suddenly changing his tone
said he; and then, when he had a
good light
says I, growing a bit bolder
I said, and by this time I was quite excited
returned one of the men
he said in a steady whisper that was
no more than audible
he asked; and when I had refused
he said to the fellow with the bandaged
head
says Doctor Livesey in his pleasantest way
he added after he had dosed them round and they had taken
his prescriptions, with really laughable humility, more like charity
schoolchildren than blood-guilty mutineers and pirates
he went on in his usual tones
the doctor interrupted, and his voice was quite changed
he continued as
the cook drew near again
said Silver when we were alone
said old Morgan, hurrying past us from
the right
said Merry, still feeling round among
the bones
said the fellow with
the bandage
cried a third pirate with a shudder
said Silver, struggling with his ashen lips to get the word out
it wailed -- for that is the word that best describes the
sound
again and again and again; and then
rising a little higher, and with an oath that I leave out
said Silver with the coolest insolence
he added, after a long pause
returned
the doctor with a sneer
