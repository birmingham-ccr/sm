he told himself, with a short and anything but mirthful
laugh
he went on, with a flavour of personal application
explained the Professor, scratching his scanty patch of
grizzled whisker with a touch of irascibility
said the Professor, beginning to fumble in all his
pockets -- was he searching for a note in Sylvia's handwriting
remonstrated Horace, not relishing this
responsibility
he heard the auctioneer saying,
mechanically
cried his rival, a
short, cheery, cherub-faced little dealer, whose neighbours adjured him
to
he began, with an involuntary stiffness
she added, with a sudden smile, that made two
enchanting dimples in her cheeks
said Horace, gloomily, still determined not to let any
direct avowal pass his lips
she said, in a half whisper
said Sylvia, meditatively, a little later, when
her mother had gone back to her letter-writing, and she and Horace were
discussing the future
cried Sylvia, clasping her pretty hands
and here a shade of rather pathetic doubt crossed his face
as did the famous jar in the
and to her father's pedantic correction of the word to
said Mrs. Rapkin, observing his
expression
said Mrs. Rapkin,
with emphasis
he began, in a rich, throaty voice, as soon as he could
speak
he put his hand in his pocket and produced a
card
said Mr. Wackerbath, at the end of the interview
began the Professor, as soon as they were seated
said the Professor, rubbing up his hair irritably
said the Professor, solemnly,
after dinner, when the neat parlourmaid had left them at dessert
said the Professor, with his wonted
amiability
said the Jinnee, beaming with satisfaction
said Horace, between his teeth
he said,
not too graciously
said Horace, pressing into his hand the
sovereign the head driver had rejected
as Horace told himself with a groan
she began,
with a dry cough of disapproval
he said, with an optimism he was very far from
feeling
said Horace, with sudden hope
said Horace, in a glow of impatience
he added, with an emotion that was not wholly insincere
returned the
Jinnee, who was apparently touched by this exordium
he added, with a touch of patronage
said Beevor, a little stiffly
as Horace thought, in the bitterness of his
soul
said Horace, evading this point
said Mrs. Rapkin, with a sniff
said the unhappy Horace, scarcely knowing what he was saying
said Ventimore, sharply -- for it was obvious that Mr.
Rapkin's studies had been lightened by copious refreshment
said Mrs. Futvoye, who was extremely stately in black,
with old lace and steel embroidery
she added, with a humorous twinkle in her
shrewd eyes
said the Professor, conscious of being
correctly clad, and unconscious that his shirt-front was bulging and his
long-eared white tie beginning to work up towards his left jaw
said Horace, helplessly, as he saw a train of
attendants laying a round cloth on the floor
said the Professor, irritably, as he let himself
down on the plumpest cushion
he said, after sipping it
observed the Professor,
with studied politeness
he himself was feeling distinctly unwell
he continued, feeling that he was in
danger of drivelling, and that he had better be as candid as he could
put in the Professor, acidly
said the Professor, scenting a bargain
said Horace, in a state of prickly heat
said the Professor, as he rose from his cushion, cracking audibly
he
said, clapping his hands, which brought an obsequious slave instantly to
his side
said Horace, with a fine assumption of candour
he added, as she made no offer to rise
said Horace, whose evening seemed to him to have been
chiefly spent in apologies
he said breathlessly, as he caught him up
thought Horace, gloomily, as he returned to his Arabian halls
he said, as he unwound his
wrapper and seated himself on the divan by Horace's side
replied the Professor, in an altered tone
said the Professor, as he removed the metal cap and
put it in his pocket
replied the Professor, who was by this time
at the outer door
said Horace, whose anger had almost evaporated in
the relief of the Jinnee's unexpected return
he cried, in a loud voice
said the Jinnee, smiling indulgently
he thought it prudent to add
replied Horace, in some anxiety as to what the
effect of his request would be
said Mrs. Rapkin, running her hand nervously along the back
of a chair
said Horace, raising his eyebrows
said the good woman, considerably impressed by this
diagnosis
he added, as he left the room
replied Beevor, as Ventimore opened the door
exclaimed Mr. Wackerbath, with an apoplectic snort
began Horace, when they were alone
said Horace, feeling deathly sick
he added, with a touch of bitterness
said Mr. Wackerbath, with elaborate irony
he added, addressing the startled
estate agent, who had jumped visibly
and he laid a hand on Horace's shrinking shoulder
shouted the infuriated Mr. Wackerbath
he cried, with an abrupt and entire change of manner
said Horace to the Jinnee
he said to the
humiliated client
Beevor said to Horace, at last, in an undertone
replied Beevor, still below his voice
began the Jinnee, after Beevor, with suspicion and
disapproval evident even on his back and shoulders, had retreated to
his own room
said Fakrash, a little abashed
said the Jinnee, in an aggravated tone
and he muttered some words and made a
sweeping gesture with his right hand
said Fakrash, with his weak and yet inscrutable smile
he
replied, with a sound between a giggle and a chuckle
she began, in a tone of
studied reserve
said Horace, looking into his hat
said Mrs. Futvoye, regaining her composure
cried Mrs. Futvoye, with an irrepressible start
she cried, without seeing Horace in her agitation
said Horace, going to her and taking both her hands
she
added, with a warning glance at her daughter
said Horace, trying to put it as considerately as
possible
declared Horace, as he knelt by her chair
endeavouring to comfort her
he protested, still anxious, if possible, to keep the
worst from her
he said, as
that lady re-entered the room
she said, as she knocked gently at the door
said his devoted wife, as she unlocked the door and turned the key on
the inside after admitting Horace
he said to Mrs. Futvoye, after they had rejoined Sylvia in the
drawing-room
replied the lady, rather
tartly
answered the Jinnee, who, like many highly
estimable persons, was almost impervious to irony
cried Horace, hardly believing his ears
he urged,
descending to flattery
said Fakrash, though he was obviously
pleased by this tribute to his talent
answered the Jinnee, after a pause
said Fakrash, in a tone not altogether free
from a kind of sombre complacency
said Horace, seeing his advantage, and pushing it
unscrupulously
he added, as
he led the way to the hall and put on his own hat and overcoat
he said, as soon as he could speak
said Sylvia, with a shudder
said Sylvia, almost in a whisper
said Fakrash to Horace,
still ignoring Sylvia
said the Jinnee, with a cunning
assumption of indifference
said the Jinnee, addressing Sylvia for the first time
began Horace, after he had gone
asked the Jinnee, suddenly re-appearing
said the Professor, as he submitted to their embraces
and incoherent congratulations
he added, with an unreasonable
outburst of ill-temper
said Sylvia,
tactfully ignoring the fact that there was scarcely an undamaged article
in the room
he added, turning to
Horace
the Professor hastened to
observe
he added, in a
whisper
said the Professor, with acidulous politeness
said Horace, between his teeth
she said, clinging to him
he said, looking at the Jinnee, who was standing opposite with a
smile of intolerable complacency
he went on,
with a strong effort to keep himself in hand
recited the Jinnee, with enthusiasm
said Horace, by no means impressed by this
catalogue of charms
continued Fakrash, as though
he had not been interrupted
said the Jinnee, in half-scornful rebuke
said Horace, feeling that this line of defence must be
abandoned
he continued, with a sudden dryness in his
throat
said Fakrash, unskinning his eyes for a second
in the first volume, and was unpleasantly
surprised to discover that the Efreet's name was actually given as
he reflected ruefully, at this point
and with
this he flung on the bed the magnificent raiment which Ventimore had
last worn on the night of his disastrous entertainment
said Horace, sitting up in bed
he
said, clutching Horace by the arm
said Horace, anxious to let the Jinnee see that he had not the
monopoly of miracles
he thought; and
then another legend caught his eye
replied the Jinnee, in some confusion
said Horace, with suppressed fury, as he alighted
said the Chief Magistrate, cordially, as he pressed
Horace's hand
said Horace, with absolute sincerity
said the Lord Mayor, as he took an anchovy
on toast
the Lord Mayor continued, with an odd
blend of pride and apology
he added, as he finished a _pate de foie gras_ sandwich
said Horace, with a sudden consciousness of his
incongruously Oriental attire
which last Horace was not aware of being, but
supposed vaguely that it had been somehow managed while he was at the
buffet in the Library
the resolution
ran, and Horace listened with all his ears
he suddenly heard the
City Chamberlain resuming
said the Lord
Mayor, rising, flushed with annoyance
he began, in an aggrieved tone
he cried, in his
indignation
continued Horace, piling it on as he proceeded
inquired the
Jinnee, with grim indulgence
he said, as soon as he
could speak
began the Jinnee, with his usual confidence
said Horace, with all the urbanity he could command
said Horace, at a venture
said the boy, and buried himself once more in his copy
of
and the provoking youth returned to
his
said the Jinnee, looking relieved but not a little foolish
as he extracted the object
cried Fakrash, re-assuming
his green robe and turban
he added, with a roll of reflected importance
in his voice
he
said pressing Horace's hand almost as warmly as he had done that October
day of the dais
continued Mr. Wackerbath, patting Horace on the shoulder
said the Professor, who was in high good humour
said
Sir Lawrence, in his most florid manner
he
added, raising his voice to address Sylvia
she added, in a lower voice, turning to Horace
said Horace, very much on his guard
said the ex-Lord Mayor
put in Lady Pountney, who had only caught a word or two
of her husband's remarks
