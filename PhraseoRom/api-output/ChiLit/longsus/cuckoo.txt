she repeated to herself, just as if
she had not been asleep at all -- like the man who fell into a trance for
a hundred years just as he was saying
and when he woke up
again finished the sentence as if nothing had happened
she exclaimed, stopping short half-way the journey to her
mouth of a spoonful of bread and milk
repeated her elder aunt, Miss Grizzel
said Miss Grizzel, consulting her watch
said poor Griselda, one day
exclaimed Griselda in a passion
repeated Miss Tabitha, holding up her
hands
continued Dorcas, who seemed inclined
to be more communicative than usual
said Griselda, feeling rather muddled
he continued, in the tone of one coming to business
he flapped his
own wings encouragingly
said Griselda, stopping short at last
he
continued, seeing that Griselda looked rather offended
said the cuckoo, for by this time they had arrived at the top of
the staircase
she said, very, very softly
he whispered as he passed
Griselda
said Griselda, with a little shiver
she said softly to herself
whispered a voice, which she knew was the cuckoo's
she continued, turning to Miss Tabitha
said Griselda, after a few moments' silence
she said in a low voice
continued Miss Grizzel in the same tone
for Miss Grizzel was a
well-read old lady, you see
she said to her sister, when they were sitting together in
the evening after Griselda had gone to bed
said Miss Grizzel, holding up her hand in a way that reminded
Griselda of the cuckoo's favourite
said Griselda, pressing her cold little face against
the colder window-pane
she said; and she certainly looked
so, for ill-humour and idleness are excellent
replied Griselda, feeling a little ashamed of
her want of civility
said the cuckoo, suddenly changing his tone
said the cuckoo's voice beside
her
he went on, with a slight
contemptuous shrug of his cuckoo shoulders
she went on, with a melancholy change of tone
said the cuckoo, when at last all was quiet again, and every blue
and every yellow butterfly seemed settled in his place
said Griselda, under her breath
said the cuckoo, hopping back a few steps and
looking up at Griselda approvingly
said the cuckoo to Griselda
she added to herself, as she
was putting on her slippers
said Miss Grizzel, who was of opinion
that smell was not a pretty word
said Griselda, shaking her head
replied the little fellow undauntedly, looking
round him
she went on, lowering her
voice a little, and looking down gravely into Phil's earnest eyes
she said suddenly, when she had eaten an orange and
three biscuits and drunk half a glass of home-made elderberry wine
said Miss Tabitha, softly shaking her head, which somehow
made her look wonderfully like an old cat, for she felt cold of an
evening and usually wore a very fine woolly shawl of a delicate grey
shade, and the borders of her cap and the ruffles round her throat and
wrists were all of fluffy, downy white
said Miss Grizzel, recovering herself a little
said Miss Tabitha with more energy than
usual
she exclaimed in a tone of reproach and disappointment
said Dorcas in a tone of relief
said Griselda dreamily, when, a few minutes
later, she was standing by the window while the old servant brushed out
