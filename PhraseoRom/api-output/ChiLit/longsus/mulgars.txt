they
kept grunting, and at every word they squeezed and edged closer and
closer, their hungry snouts in air -- closer and closer, till Nod had to

he said aloud to the Gunga
said Gunga, throwing back his head
said Nod, peeping with his eye

yelped the old Fish-catcher,
starting up
said the old Queen Quatta
squealed one of the Minimuls in a fury
