said Fanny, raising her matter-of-fact quiet face from her
endless work
and coming to the astonished Mr.
Lawley, bowed, scraped, and said
pointing towards the lower end of the room
and a tolerably
smart slap on the face followed -- leaving a red mark on a cheek already
aflame with, anger and indignation
said Russell, as he saw the mark on Eric's cheek
here Barker
seized him, and every word brought a tremendous blow on the head, but
blind with passion Eric went on
he continued, turning to the group that
surrounded him
said Duncan, as they went out of school
he cried, seizing both Eric's hands
said Duncan, one morning as they strolled into the
school-yard
continued Montagu, leaning on his racquet
and looking after him, as Russell left the court
he said, pushing the paper from him in a pet
said the master, softening in a moment, and laying his
hand gently on Russell's head
said little
Vernon Williams, as his brother strolled in after morning school
said Eric, pulling out his watch
said his aunt, pushing back his hair from his
forehead, and kissing it softly
or they would have amusing
said Eric, when he had passed
said Montagu, playfully shaking
Eric by the shoulder
said Russell,
affectionately taking his hand
he said, still louder and more sternly
while Upton was trying to win him over to
he
continued, with annoying blandness of tone
answered one of the group
he kindly detained Eric, and said to him
he said, pulling Pietrie's ear (as he sometimes does, you know
said Russell, looking at his watch
said Montagu, with a violent start
said Eric hastily, tearing off his jacket and
waistcoat
said one of the sailors, touching his cap
he continued to
the servant
said the Doctor, with difficulty making
his young companion catch his words amid the uproar of the elements
thought he, as he looked down and saw that the
ledge on which they had been standing had long been covered with deep
and agitated waves
he said, as the boy
gratefully and eagerly took the flowers
said Eric, shocked and flustered
said he, raising his hands quietly to Eric's
face
and with Russell's arm round his neck he sat down,
beside his pillow, and read to him about
and here the reader's musical voice
rose into deeper and steadier sweetness
he said with a start,
as he caught the eye of Vernon Williams
he said to the fellows, who had thronged in from all the
dormitories at the first hint of a fight
he
continued, pointing out of the window to change the subject
said Wildney, laughing, and looking at
Eric with his dark eyes
whispered he, irreverently designating an
under-master named Harley
said Wildney, whose courage had
risen
said Eric, taking a long breath as they got out again into the
moonlight
said the latter, as they ran up stairs
he said, after a pause
it was the first time for two
years that Mr. Rose had called him
and he winced a
little
said Duncan, with more seriousness than was usual with
him
said Wildney in his fascinating way
said Mr. Rose, with cold and quiet dignity
echoed Eric with a scornful laugh
he said, looking up at the ceiling
he continued, dropping
his cheek on his hand again
said Montagu, taking the hand which was repelling him
he said, in an altered tone
His voice was
choked by sobs for a time
He tried in vain to go on;
but Eric's conscience continued for him
said Eric, by a
sudden impulse
he added, laying his hand for the last time on
Eric's head
remonstrated Wright, who, with Vernon, was sitting
reading a book at one of the desks
said Brigson, unaccustomed to being opposed
among his knot of courtiers
said some of the worst boys present
said Brigson, in a loud whisper
again he turned upon Brigson
answered Montagu, with a sigh
he added after a pause
said Wildney, clapping his hands
said Duncan emphatically, after a louder burst of
merriment than usual
continued Montagu, pointing to the
mischievous-looking little boy
asked Bull, with
his usual insufferable drawl
flung in Eric; and turning to Montagu, he said
he said, doggedly, thrusting himself between them
he said aloud, in a tone of sarcasm
he said, as the boy came up and affectionately took his
hand
he added, half to himself
whispered he, in a timid voice
as he should have done, stood up, with a foolish look, and
said
said Eric, starting up with sudden energy
he added, with an authoritative
gesture
he
said, approaching the doctor in an imploring attitude
he said, after a long pause
said the Doctor kindly,
patting his stooping head
said Vernon playfully, as he wiped a tear which had overflowed on his
brother's cheek
pointing to the block of quartz, still red with
blood-stained hair
he said to the man
but Charlie ran away, saying
and
then a chorus of voices took up that awful cry, voices of expostulation,
voices of contempt, voices of indignation, voices of menace; they took
up the cry, and repeated and re-echoed it; but, most unendurable of all,
there were voices of wailing and voices of gentleness among them, and
his soul died within him as he caught, amid the confusion of condemning
sounds, the voices of Russell and Vernon, and they, too, were saying to
him, in tender pity and agonized astonishment
said Eric, with a heavy sigh, as the image of Vernon instantly
passed through his mind
exclaimed the skipper with a sudden start, next morning, as he
saw Eric's recumbent figure on the ratlin-stuff
said one of the sailors
he added, relenting a little
shouted the skipper to him from the
hatchway
he
said, and the tears were in his eyes
he murmured, as he rested his weary head upon her lap,
while he sat on a low stool at her feet
he murmured faintly, leaning back
said Wildney, laying his hand upon his friend's
lips
he murmured, in broken
tones
