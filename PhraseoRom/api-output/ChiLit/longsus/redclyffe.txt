said Philip, when the flower had been duly admired
said Laura, as she went
said Charles, tormenting her hand still
more, and pulling her curls
said poor Mr.
Edmonstone, only half conscious of his offence
there she paused, and added,-- tete-a-tete
said Guy, his colour rising
said Amy; and looking shyly at Guy, she
added
was going to take
it up rather as if he was putting a force upon himself, when Philip
more quickly took the first volume, and eagerly turned over the pages -- I
can't stand this,' he said
laying a particular stress on the word
said Mrs. Edmonstone, replying for her daughter
said Philip, with a smile
cried Guy, indignantly; then, controlling himself, he continued
but he spoke with an effort
he added, his eyes kindling, then
changing in a moment to a sorrowful, resolute tone
He covered his face with his hands, then recovering and turning to Mrs.
Edmonstone, he said
said he, checking himself in the midst of his vehemence
said Guy, gravely,
though smiling
said Guy; and sinking his voice, as if
he was communicating a most painful fact, he added
said
Mr. Lascelles, with a due regard to a probable want of habits of
application; but then, remembering how much was undone, he added, that
said Mrs. Edmonstone, in her quiet way;
and Guy with an expression between drollery and simplicity, said
said Charles, throwing his head back
said Guy, his voice low, but quivering with
indignation
proceeded Guy, wrapped
up in his own thoughts
cried he, with sudden vehemence
said Guy, suddenly recalled, and colouring deeply
asked Mr. Edmonstone, startled from his nap; and
his wife looked up anxiously, but returned to her book, as her nephew
replied
cried Laura, colouring with eagerness
cried Mrs. Edmonstone and Charles at once
said Mrs.
Edmonstone, looking at him with affectionate anxiety, which seemed
suddenly to change the current of his thought, for he exclaimed
abruptly
said Guy, leaning on the chimneypiece
said he, sadly: but as Mrs.
Edmonstone waited, doubtful as to whether she might be about to make
disclosures for which he was unprepared, he added, hastily
and an
expression denoting the remembrance of great suffering came over his
face; then, pausing a moment, he said
said Mrs. Edmonstone, looking into another letter
but here again she was obliged to stop, for the next
sentence spoke of
replied Philip, much more kindly than she thought she
deserved, after the reproach that seemed to her so dreadfully naughty
he proceeded, in a tone of extreme
bitterness, though with a sort of smile
had it not
been for a sort of involuntary respect to the gentle compassion of the
softened hazel eyes regarding him so kindly, he would have used the
violent expletive that trembled on his lip
said Charles, as Guy swung himself down with a bound, his face
much redder than sun and work had already made it
began Laura; but Lady
Eveleen cut her short, frankly holding out her hand, and saying
as Guy began to
look for his coat
muttered Guy, out of countenance
said Philip, retreating to his chair, and speaking with great
composure
said Amy, pointing to it, on
Laura's head
and she smiled much more
said he, giving her his arm
was Philip's answer, with a cold smile, and Mr.
Thorndale stood uncomfortable under the disapprobation, attracted by
Eveleen's beauty and grace, yet so unused to trust his own judgment
apart from
said Guy then, with a
sudden transition
said Philip, trying to resume his usual
tone
and he did not even
attempt to conceal the trembling and tenderness of his voice
what delight the words gave her
said Laura, starting up, and laughing, with a slight
degree of constraint, which caused Amy, who was helping her to dress, to
exclaim
said Guy, turning on her all the
pleading eloquence of his eyes
added she, advancing
towards him
said Guy, thinking it compassion, not regret
and her voice lost its piteous tone
said Guy, smiling; then, as he took his place by Mrs.
Edmonstone
said Guy, puzzled for a moment, but quickly looking relieved, and
laughing
added Charles, when the laugh was over
said Guy, murmuring low, as if trying to find the real
indictment
said Guy, stopping and considering, then going
on with a better satisfied air
but the maidenly feeling checked her
again, and she said
said he, in a low voice
said Charles, reading them
contemptuously
said Amy, her cheeks lighting up
said Charles, when all were out of hearing but his mother
said Mrs. Edmonstone, trying to console herself
and she felt as if she was making a desperate plunge
said poor little Amy, hurriedly
he
added, after another brief pause
he said; and she whispered another
said he, looking full at her carnation cheeks
I give you joy, my small woman,' said he, talking the more
nonsense because of the fullness in his throat
and she kissed him, she could not blush more,
poor little thing, for she had already reached her utmost capability of
redness
her lips formed the words, without uttering
them
said Amy folding her hands, and standing
with her face raised
said Philip in an expressive tone; yet, as if he was not very
much amazed
cried Mr. Edmonstone, now fully provoked
said Guy, as the child hung
her head, and, crimsoned with blushes, could scarcely whisper her timid
as he came towards the end
said Mrs. Henley, detaining him
cried Mr. Edmonstone, joyfully beating his own hand with his
glove
said Mr. Edmonstone, turning away
and the tears filled her eyes, and she spoke with almost childish
simplicity of manner
said Philip, looking full at his uncle
and he struck his fist against it
cried Amy, caressingly, and much distressed
said Guy to his tutor
said Guy,
kindly; and she looked up in his face, and exclaimed
said he, breaking silence, when they had walked about half
way back to the farm
said Guy, speaking fast
and low, and repressing the feeling, which, nevertheless, affected his
voice
said Guy, colouring deeply, and all irritation
disappearing from voice and manner
would be thundered forth, and he could
not, with truth, answer
but it was one of his maxims that a
man need never be forced into an open quarrel, and he tranquilly
continued
said Philip; then, while Guy bit his lip till it bled,
the pain really a relief, by giving some vent to his anger at the
implied doubt, he went on
said he, in his frank, natural voice
said Guy (an answer rather to the
spirit than the words
said Charles, when she returned to him after dinner
he answered; and they proceeded for some
minutes in silence, until he said
said Laura, smiling, and looking, half sadly, half proudly, up
to his noble features
said Guy, with a smile
who was king, state, supreme authority, in their eyes;
and Mrs. Ashford further found that
cried Edward Ashford, rushing in, so as to bring the first news
to his mother, who had not been to the early service
said Mrs. Lavers, wiping her eyes
said he, 'there was some of us thought you might not
like to have us coming and singing like old times, 'cause
said Guy, touched by the
rough delicacy of feeling manifested by these poor men
exclaimed Guy, looking at Mrs. Ashford, in
amazement; then, as it flashed on him that it was his part to give
leave, he added
said Markham, roughly, though not with the repellent manner
usual with him towards Mr. Ashford
called Jem, who, being forbidden to do anything but watch,
did so earnestly
he shouted, to his rejected volunteer, who had been very
active in bringing in the boat
answered Guy, and they walked on quickly
for some minutes; after which he said, in a low voice and hurried
manner
he added, with a fresh start
and she ran out
of the room, found her mother fortunately alone, and said, averting her
face
said Charlotte, emphatically, as with her best
pen, and with infinite satisfaction, she indited the
said Guy, after an effort
and a flash of joy came over him
and
he pressed his lips firmly together
said he to his uncle; then to Mr.
Edmonstone
and, as Mrs. Edmonstone answered with a smile, she ventured further
to say
interrupted Laura; then, afraid of
saying too much, she added
said Guy, becoming conscious that he had been very severe
his voice trembled, and the tears were in her
eyes
said she, scarcely repressing a disposition to laugh
replied Amy, in a soft, low voice, with _such_ a look of
truth in her clear eyes
and he held fast one of her hands, as
they sat together on the sofa
said Amy, looking up, with the gentle resolution that had lately
grown on her
out came something, very like a sunny smile,
though some tears followed
she
added, after a long silence, during which Guy's feeling would not let
him speak
said Amy, colouring a good deal
thought poor Laura, while her mother continued
said Guy, preparing to go
replied he, after a little pause
she had tears
in her eyes
when they had listened for
a long time
said Amy, after a time
said Amy; and Laura, alarmed lest
she might have betrayed him, started, and tried to recover herself;
but she saw Amy was quite unsuspicious, and the relief from this fright
helped her through what her sister was saying
said Amy, as if she wished to be convinced
said
she, with a rising tear
and the grunt was of softer tone
and
gazed long and intently as he rocked on the green waters, till he again
spoke to himself
said Amy; then,
remembering that he could not bear to hear Philip under-rated, she
added
whispered Eveleen, as Amy
passed to her embrace, while Aunt Charlotte hastily kissed Charles,
and proceeded
said Charles, rallying his spirits
said Laura, bursting into tears; and, as her
mother was gone, she could not help adding, 'but don't try to comfort
me, Guy; don't blame yourself
said the bride, after a few minutes had faded the rainbow, and
turned them from its sight
he said, speaking from the rock under which the brushwood
grew
she said, coming to meet him
asked Guy, scarcely as if replying to her, while, though his arm
pressed hers, his eye was on the blue sky, as he answered himself
said the cavaliere, as they walked away
he continued, feeling
this reply inconsistent with his contempt for Guy's youth
said Guy, looking up from his letter
answered Philip, who would not
lay himself open to the accusation of being uncandid
said Amy, as Anne departed -- and he looked disconcerted, as
a precise man always does when catching himself in a mistake
she blushed
and looked down
said Guy, at that last moment
said
Philip, with a proud stem air, implying
again said Philip, in a much weaker voice, and after lying
still a little longer, he faintly whispered
said he, entering with a quiet bright look
and he rose, and walked about the room
said Philip, turning round,
and settling himself for conversation, with much of his ordinary
deliberate preparation
he added, breaking off with trembling eagerness
at length said Guy, entering
with so remarkable a melancholy and beauty in
his voice, that she could hardly refrain from tears, and it also greatly
struck Philip, who had been so near
said he, looking steadily at her
he answered, in a worn, dejected tone
she shrank and
shivered, but did not exclaim, for he looked so calm and happy that she
did not like to interrupt him
said she, putting her arm round her
she answered
herself in a tone of despair, as she hid her face in her hands
said Mrs. Edmonstone, trying
to bring herself to speak it explicitly
cut her
mother more deeply than all; but there was only coldness in the tone
of the answer
said Mrs. Edmonstone, with the odd sort of laugh with
which even the most sensitive people, in the height of their troubles,
reply to anything ludicrous
proceeded Charles, serious, though somewhat roguish
and her mother kissed her warmly
thought Mary to herself, as she looked back at
him
he said one day; and more than
once the sigh broke from him almost unconsciously
then, seeing her look
startled
so affecting
when thus spoken; but at last he came to
A struggle for breath
gave an instant's look of pain, then he whispered so that she could but
just hear
thought she; and withal Guy's words returned
said she, as he was setting forth
said Mrs. Edmonstone, much distressed
said Philip, holding out his hand; but Mr. Edmonstone
withheld it, trying his patience by an endless quantity of discursive
half-sentences, apparently without connection with each other, about
disappointment, and hopes, and being sorry, and prospects, and its
said Philip, recovering, and sitting up
said Amabel, with the air of decision that had lately
grown on her
said she, with _that_ smile
cried he, starting up in consternation
said he, in a husky voice
he paused, and exclaimed, as if carried away
in spite of himself
said Amy, in her sweet, calm tone
she had her hand on it all the time,
as if it was a pleasure to her to touch it again
said Philip, in a low, grave, heartfelt tone; and as she
took the pen, and was writing his name below the old inscription, he
added
as he saw her write
he
hesitated, and spoke very low
was his mother's, as she threw her
arms around him, with redoubled kisses and streaming tears; and there
was a trembling tone in his father's
and Laura found herself giving way to her tears, in spite of all
her previous exhortations to Charlotte, about self-control
he interrupted, with surprise and eagerness
then interrupting himself, he added, authoritatively
said Philip, who was leaning back wearily; but the next moment
he exclaimed
asked Mrs. Henley, with whom those were the
first of qualities; and as her brother paused from repugnance to speak
of Amabel to one so little capable of comprehending her, she proceeded
he
added; speaking with effort
he answered, with a sigh
said Charles, with
a shade of imitation of his measured tones
and, as he
was hardly prepared to answer, she continued
said Amy, with a
persuasive smile, partaking of her old playfulness, adding, very much
in earnest
then came a
pause, while he put his hand over his face, and seemed struggling with
irrepressible emotion; and after all he was obliged to take two walks to
the window before he could recover composure, and could ask in a voice
which he tried to make calm and steady, though his face was deeply
flushed
said Mrs. Edmonstone, coming in
then, as Amy put back the coverings to show
the little face nestled to sleep on her bosom
said Charles, who as usual remained at the vicarage during the
two services, and who perceived what passed in her mind
exclaimed Philip, as if unable to control the pain it gave him
and her
voice sounded especially sad in the subdued tone in which she spoke,
that she might not disturb the child
said Laura, with tears in her eyes
said Laura, a little entreatingly, yet as if she
must needs put the question
said
Laura, excited by this shade of blame to defend him vehemently
said Philip, earnestly;-- then
interrupting himself, he shaded his eyes from the light
said he, as she kissed him
said Philip, as he
crossed the court with Amabel
said Charles to Amy, when they talked it over alone
said she, going at once, and she saw him
no more till nearly an hour after; when, as she was coming out of her
own room, he met her, and gave it into her hands, saying nothing except
a smothered
said Mrs. Edmonstone, going on with her own thoughts
said Philip, rising; then,
turning to Amy
