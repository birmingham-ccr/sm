says mine host, rising purple-faced, while the moan is still
coming out of the Stwun
as we say in the
Vale
cries a stout, motherly woman in a red
cloak, as they enter the field
cries she, raising herself from the embrace
replied the
farmer, with a grim smile, as he lifted the latch of his door
says
the guard, smacking his hand down on his knee and looking full into
Tom's face
had come down upon several of the performers
says the guard, after giving a sharp toot-toot
said the old guard,
pulling his horn out of its case and tootle-tooing away, while the
coachman shook up his horses, and carried them along the side of the
school close, round Dead-man's corner, past the school-gates, and down
the High Street to the Spread Eagle, the wheelers in a spanking trot,
and leaders cantering, in a style which would not have disgraced
says East, pulling up, and taking another look at Tom
said his friend, as they strolled up towards the
school-gates, in explanation of his conduct
said East, as soon as he got his wind, looking with much
increased respect at Tom
as East proudly informs Tom
says the
praepostor, rising with his prize
he says; and then
feeling his limbs, adds
gasps Tom, as his wind comes back
said East, hobbling along as
fast as he could
said East, stopping to look at him and rest his leg
said Tom, as pleased as possible
and other vociferous songs in rapid succession,
including
loud cheers of "That we will
loud
cheers for the Doctor
said Flashman, lugging the wretched boy along
sang out another of the big boys
called out the praepostor, sitting
up and looking round his curtains; and the Tadpole and young Green sank
down into their disordered beds; and then, looking at his watch, added
said Tom, mopping away, and gulping down his disappointment
remarked East, breaking
the silence
replied old
Thomas, motioning towards the stairs at the end of the passage which led
up into the Doctor's house; and the boys turned ruefully down it, not
cheered by the old verger's muttered remark
said East, indicating the mass of clay behind
which he was standing
began the Doctor, drawing himself up with
his back to the fire, the chisel in one hand and his coat-tails in the
other, and his eyes twinkling as he looked them over
said East, stepping out, and not liking that the Doctor
should think lightly of his running powers
said East, looking down at
himself
said the
Tadpole, as they reached their bedroom; and in half an hour afterwards
they were sitting by the fire in the housekeeper's room at a sumptuous
tea, with cold meat
said he at last, rousing himself to snuff the candle
answered East, without
looking up from an early number of
cried East, putting his finger on the place
and looking up
added
East, after a moment's pause
roared out Flashman,
coming to his open door
as Tom said triumphantly to the rest of the
rebels
shouts the opener, holding it up
the words came feebly and slowly
goes on Tom, opening his eyes
she
adds, looking very serious
said Diggs, from the end of the hall, rousing up and
resting himself on his elbow
said Diggs, with a grin, and
snapping his great red fingers
said Diggs, getting leisurely off the table
said Flashman surlily, sitting up
answered Flashman, holding his handkerchief to the
place
said Tom, putting up his hand
Tom used
to say to East
cried East, holding up a miserable, coarse fish
or two and a small jack
shouted Tom, who was sitting
in his shirt paddling with his feet in the river
thought he, and began gently
shifting it to get it alongside of him
said East, when they were dismissed
added the Doctor, emphasizing the
words
said the Doctor, with something like a sigh
shouted one, seizing on the methodical, active,
little dark-eyed woman, who was busy stowing away the linen of the boys
who had already arrived into their several pigeon-holes
cried another (she was called indifferently by either
name
cries Mary, at last getting in a word
went on the little matron, when the rest had gone
said she, in almost a whisper
burst in Tom, with something like a sigh at the effort
cried Hall, detecting Arthur and catching him by
the collar
said Tom, stepping on to the floor, every drop
of blood in his body tingling
broke out East, springing at
the young gentleman who addressed them, and catching him by the
collar
said East, patting the top of his hat
said the little boy, looking up with the great tears in
his eyes
said Tom, taking his hand out of his back hair, and delighted to
throw his Gradus ad Parnassum on to the sofa
said East, with his mouth full
cried he, holding out three moor-hen's eggs
said Martin, pulling up on the brow of a slope
at the bottom of which lay Lawford brook, and pointing to the top of the
opposite slope
struck in the incorrigible East
said Tom, smelling at
him cautiously
shouted he,
as Holmes stands between Martin and Willum
said Holmes, warning off Willum and the prong with
his stick, while Diggs faced the other shepherd, cracking his fingers
like pistol-shots
cried East, now released from the farmer's grip
said he, as he marched along in the middle of
them
cries East, always ready to leave
muttered he, regardless of prudence
said he, giving Arthur a cuff on the head with
his other hand
said Tom, shouldering into the crowd
said Tom to a small
School-house boy, who was off like a rocket to Harrowell's, just
stopping for a moment to poke his head into the School-house hall, where
the lower boys were already at tea, and sing out
as East
mutters to Martin
added the Doctor, as he stopped at the turret-door
said young Brooke, nodding to him
said Arthur, looking up seriously into Tom's laughing eyes
rejoined Tom (the use of the old name, dear to
him from old recollections, made Arthur start and smile and feel quite
happy
said Tom, speaking slow, and
looking much moved
said Tom, shaking his fist at Arthur, half vexed
and half pleased
said Arthur gently, after another
minute
said East, proceeding to do as he was bidden
cried East, having hit on a new idea
said East, speaking slowly and
impressively
said Tom, getting up in something as like a huff as he was
capable of
said East, catching hold of him
as East thought, but didn't say
after examining the new fishing-rod, which both pronounced to be the
genuine article
he went on, after a pause
sings out Jack Raggles, the
long-stop, toughest and burliest of boys, commonly called
shouted Arthur, dropping his bat and
clapping furiously, and Tom joined in with a
answered Tom, looking up roguishly
said the master, with a chuckle
answers the boy who carries it
he says, as he
sits down again
