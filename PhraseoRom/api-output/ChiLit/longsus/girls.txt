said an imperious baby voice
responded Hester, in a much more cheerful tone, for it was
really quite impossible to keep up reserve with such a bright-looking
little old lady
continued Hester, who was rather flattered by
all this bustle and Miss Jane's agitation
she continued, glancing first at
her sister and then addressing Hester
he said in cheering tones
she added, with the
dawning of a faint smile on her poor, sad little face
she said, in her sauciest tones
she exclaimed, turning round and gazing full into
Hester's shy face
said the voice in the bed sleepily
then
more sleepily, and in a lower key
replied the rather irate Alice
continued Susan in a meditative tone
she said, in confidence that night
she added, turning round with a very gracious
smile to Hester
she said, when the two girls found themselves
inside the small inclosure
she added, assuming a little tone of extra
refinement
came from several suppressed voices here and there through the
room
answered Cecil, and now her voice was a little less
agitated and broken, and she looked full into the face of her teacher
she said, looking up with imploring eyes
she added, looking up with a strong and
sweet light in her face
continued Mrs Willis, in that clear
patient voice of hers
said Cecil, in a steady tone, and now
fixing her eyes on Annie, who knelt by her side
she said, after a long pause
asked Susan, stretching herself and yawning
said Annie, rather timidly for her
he said, in his
kind and fatherly tones
added Annie Forest, raising her eyes to the clergyman's
face
said Mr Everard to Mrs Willis
she said, in her emphatic and clear tones
said little Janie West
in a regretful tone, as she gobbled down a particularly luscious
chocolate cream
as a very small fat baby began to whimper
said one of the girls maliciously
she said in a patronising tone
said the head-mistress in her kindest voice
she said, raising her round face to Annie's
suddenly exclaimed Julia Morris, a particularly unobservant girl
she said, as Annie flew to pick up the child, who,
falling with some force on her head, had been stunned
said Annie, whose face was quite as
pale as Hester's, and her eyes heavy as though she longed to cry
she whispered in a hoarse voice
said the governess in a kind voice
said Mrs Willis very gravely
she said over and over
she said, pointing to a photograph of a retriever
said Annie a little contemptuously
she called in a whisper to her companions
said the gypsy in a whining voice
she was often heard to
say
said Dora, when they found themselves both seated
in the bower
said Mary Morris,
beginning to sob
she asked, after a pause
said Dora Russell, who could no longer contain her outraged
feelings
she said, when the weeping Annie
had left the room
said Susan, a queer grey colour
coming over her face
she said, after a pause of anxious thought
said little Annie, gazing full into her mother's face
with her sweet bright eyes
said Nan, who saw with consternation two big tears in Annie's
eyes
she laughed, after a moment
she added after a pause
said Mrs Willis, in a tone half of pain, half of relief
she said at last in a slightly timid tone
said Miss Jane, turning to her sister
echoed several girls;
and then two or three young faces were turned toward Hester, and some
voice said almost scornfully
she said, going down on her knees, and looking full into his
ugly but intelligent face
said Annie, speaking cheerfully, and rising to her feet
she said at last piteously
said Mrs Willis very quietly
she said, turning apologetically to
Hester
said Hester, without an instant's pause
she added, raising her
eyes to the clergyman's face
he whispered low in her car
murmured the head-mistress; then
she bade Cecil
Mrs Willis always managed to quiet her by saying
he added, turning
to Hester
she said, standing in her accustomed place at the head of
the long school-room
