said Bullinger, looking up at the clock
asked Raleigh of the Sixth, the school captain, of
his companion, as they stopped to examine this mysterious announcement
said Raleigh reading it, and smiling in spite of
himself
suddenly shouted Ricketts to Pembury, who was jogging
along on his crutches a little way ahead, towards the school
said Wraysford, in a voice which won over Stephen at
once
exclaimed Stephen, starting up, very red in the face, as his
brother went to the door
cried the small boy, growing very
bold and patronising all of a sudden
observed the other,
with the air of a man of forty
shouted Master Paul, as a very swift ball from
Ricketts took Bullinger's middle stump clean out of the
ground
that was the school
captain
said the indignant owner of the study
cried the voice of Wraysford, half an hour later
said he to Paul, on hearing this announcement
he said, when the operation was over
said the
Doctor, suppressing a smile by a very hard twitch
said the Doctor, as Stephen was leaving
added Stephen, rising with indignation
said he, when shortly afterwards he met Oliver
exclaimed Wraysford,
clapping the lame boy on the back
said Loman, who in the presence of this universal genius was
quite deferential
said he to his fag
old Cripps was a
widower, and his family consisted of the landlord of the Cockchafer
he said, at parting, with a sort of sigh
said Raleigh, who was
blissfully ignorant of the whole matter
said Raikes, one of the monitors
began Loman, feeling not quite so confident now as he
had felt five minutes ago
said the poet of the "Love-Ballad
said Loman, losing his temper
called he to
the group outside
said Stephen, laughing at the idea
said he, after a pause
continued Oliver, forgetting all about
his temper
and
copied his Caesar out of the
shouted Bramble, jumping
up on to a form
said Bramble, in a most sepulchral
undertone
said Callonby, as he was turning to depart
said he, when he had
exhausted his vocabulary (not a small one) of expletives
snivelled, old Mr Cripps, who had entered during this last
speech
added he, with a sigh
he presently began, in as off-hand a manner as he could
assume under the depressing circumstances
and here followed a lie which till that moment had not been in the
speaker's mind to tell
he began again, speaking for the sake of speaking, and
not even knowing what he was going to say
Here the
street door opened, and there entered hurriedly a boy whom Loman, to his
confusion and consternation, recognised as Simon of the Fifth, the
author of the
said Mr Cripps, unbending a little
asked Pembury of Tom Senior one day
but was
awfully obliged by this one, which was first-rate, a recommendation
which sent Simon away happy to his study, there immediately to compose
the opening stanza of his famous epic
went on just as if
Wraysford had never abandoned it; and the poem on the Guinea-pigs,
promised in Number 1, by the author of
for he had placed it in the column
devoted to
exclaimed that worthy, giving over his irascible expletives, and
adopting an air of unfeigned pleasure
said Wren, the first whom he encountered
said Loman, wishing he was anywhere but where he
was
and here a
brilliant idea suddenly struck him
said Pembury, near whom Loman, as well as our two Guinea-pigs,
found themselves
exclaimed Loman, in a passion
said Oliver one evening about a week after the
match
he gasped, catching hold of the back
of a chair for support
said Loman, when he was sure that he had
really heard correctly
said Loman, his face becoming crimson
exclaimed Loman, looking down on his victim
exclaimed Mr Rastle, when in due time the young
hero's turn came to stand up and answer a question
exclaimed Stephen, moved far more by Mr Rastle's kind tone
than by his letting him off thirty lines of the Caesar
said the boy, at parting
cried Stephen, turning quite yellow
said the Doctor, sternly, eyeing the culprits
one by one
began the head master, very gravely
said the Doctor, turning to the row of
abashed culprits
said the
Doctor, after the masters had returned to his study
became quite a common
objurgation in the Form, among the diligent; as common, in fact, as
said Callonby to Wren one day, when the two
happened to hit on the topic of the hour
said Oliver, looking very morose
pursued Oliver, evidently bent on a melancholy tack
replied Wraysford, resting on his oar
added he, walking up to Cripps
said Wraysford, quietly walking up to the blackguard in the
midst of this discourse
pursued Stephen, still more falteringly
faltered Stephen; but Oliver shut
him up, and turning to Wraysford said
cried Stephen in great distress
said Ricketts to a small knot of his class-fellows
chimed in another knowing one
said another of
these amiable warriors
said Stephen, with a gulp
said Stephen, as they went along
said Stephen, who had no desire to continue his
acquaintance with his late
said he, addressing his younger brother, who at that moment
entered proudly in his new capacity as Wraysford's fag
said Oliver, as they walked back
cried Pembury, as the two entered
said Ricketts, calmly,
comprehending the whole class in his
said Tom Senior, with noble
impartiality
and here the Doctor grew still more
fidgety
said Simon, suddenly, addressing Oliver in a peculiarly
knowing tone
said Bullinger, who was one of Wraysford's chums
began Simon, with a most aggravating cheerfulness
said he, in troubled tones
said Wraysford, not looking up
said Wraysford, with a groan
said
Simon, in a voice as though he would say
said Ricketts, giving utterance to what was passing in
the minds of nearly all his class-fellows
he shouted, as the elder boy entered
said Wraysford, as coolly as he could
whispered he to Oliver, who sat in front of him
said Wraysford, drily, and evidently not liking these
marked congratulations
said Ricketts: then turning to Oliver, he
added, mockingly
said Pembury, with a
sarcastic smile
began Simon, nervously, but smiling most affably
said Oliver, rising to
his feet
said Simon, off whom all such pretty side compliments
as these were wont to roll like water off a duck's back
said Simon, not at all put about by this rough handling
said he, in as free and easy a manner as one
fellow can assume to others who he knows dislike him
exclaimed
the virtuous landlord of the Cockchafer
said Mr Cripps, with a grin
said Loman, pale and quite humble in
the presence of his creditor
said Loman, following up this temporary advantage
he repeated, disregarding the
impatience of the other
said he one day to Ricketts
to begin with, and volunteered to supplement this
contribution with one or two smaller pieces, such as
said Stephen, changing the subject
went on Mrs Greenfield towards the end of the
letter
persisted Stephen, not half satisfied
to a man and when to call
cried Mr Cripps, coolly joining the boy as he walked with the
other players back to the school
whispered he, in an agitated voice
said Dr Senior one day, as the masters met for five
minutes' talk in the head master's study
reads the Doctor from his list
shouts one small voice up somewhere near the
ceiling, whereat there is a mighty laugh and cheer, and Bramble turns
crimson in the face, and tells his grandmother gloomily
says the Doctor, referring to his list
said Pembury, after a long silence
and here Tony
pulls up short, in a state of perturbation
said the Doctor, presently, steering round to a subject which it
had been for some time in his mind to question his son about
said the Doctor,
half angrily
both groaned simultaneously, as much as to say
was all he could say, as their eyes met
as the old copybooks say in
elegant Virgilian Latin
said Wraysford, as the boy entered
suggested the owner of the title
exclaimed Oliver, suddenly firing up
said the potboy, with a leer, and touching his
cap
said Wren, coming up just at this moment
began Loman, scarcely
knowing what he said
said Simon, shifting his ground slightly
he said, after half an hour's waiting
said Mr Jellicott that morning, when the Fifth
and Sixth were assembled together in the lecture-theatre
said Simon, laughing at Pembury's innocence
began Pembury, after a pause
once more began Pembury, amid dead silence
said Loman, gaining courage, as he found neither
Oliver nor Wraysford disposed to resent his visit
said Oliver, abruptly, after another pause, during which he had
evidently made up his mind
said he, in the old familiar tones
said Simon, seeing a chance
concluded Bramble, at the end of another oration
said Loman, miserable and half frightened
said Cripps, unfolding it and reading out, with his
back to the boy
said he, slowly, and in an agitated voice
continued Oliver, plunging into his jersey
says Stansfield, as his men walk out once more to the
fray
went on the Doctor, turning again to the boys
cried Paul, not waiting for the Tadpole to guess
said Stephen, with considerable misgivings about the
said Stephen, with a queer shyness
said Wraysford, after he had gone
said Stephen, very red, turning round abruptly after this awkward
pause had continued for a minute or two
said Mr Rastle, as they went
said he, the moment the boy entered
replied Oliver -- and there was no help for it
continued Cripps, becoming quite sentimental over
his wrongs
broke in Mr Cripps, in the midst of this meditation
which objection Mr Loman quietly silenced by saying
said the boy, with a gulp
said Oliver, laying his hand on the unhappy boy's arm
said Stephen, taking his brother's arm
