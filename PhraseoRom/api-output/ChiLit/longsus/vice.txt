cried Paul, with evident alarm
grumbled Dick, not considering so
much anxiety at all flattering
said his father, with more composure
he said, speaking with more animation than he had yet
done
said his father drily, apparently not much influenced by
this inducement
he little knew how literally he was to be
taken at his word
stammered Paul, determined to know the worst
he said, with another
giggle
he said, with a gleam
of returning hopefulness
suggested Dick, who had shown throughout the most
unsympathetic cheerfulness
said Dick, who all this time was sitting on a corner of the
table, swinging his legs
cried the justly-enraged father
he
said to the false Dick
he kept muttering to himself, with shaking lips
he said aloud; and letting down the window,
leaned out and shouted
said Clegg, with an approach to sentiment
said Clegg, hesitating, to Paul's joy
he cried with lofty
contempt as he saw from Paul's face that the coin was not producible
said the Doctor presently, and his
first words dashed all Paul's rising hopes
said the Doctor, glancing up at the great clock-face on which
a reflector cast a patch of dim yellow light
one to which an
answer is neither desired nor expected, especially as he continued
almost immediately
said poor Mr. Bultitude, with a
desperate attempt at his most conversational and instructive manner
said the Doctor, with some impatience
said the Doctor, now effectually roused
he said, with the air of one used
to having his way in these matters
he said with polite determination
said Paul, pointing the finger of denunciation at
the astonished Coggs
said Paul, thinking to banter them agreeably
he thought, as he reached it breathless and
trembling
said one boy, resuming the interrupted conversation
said Chawner, in a low, soft voice, which had a suggestion of
feminine spitefulness
said Mr. Bultitude, losing his temper
said the Doctor with terrible grimness
said a housemaid, meeting him on the
staircase
pleaded Biddlecomb, and Paul
felt gratefully towards him at the words
said Paul, thinking, not without
reason, that this course of treatment was likely to prove painful
said the Doctor in his most awful voice
he was saying with
magnificent disdain
he went on, with a soft chuckle, as at
recollections of unspeakable devilry
here he began gradually to relax his self-restraint and lash
himself into a frenzy of indignation
said the Doctor, with a slow and withering scorn
said the Doctor, suddenly producing a lithe brown cane
he said, with a wicked wink
cried Coggs, slipping off his bed and staring wildly
he said, his hot
breath hissing through the chair rungs
protested Paul, lowering his
chair on discovering that there was no immediate danger
said Paul, with the convincing earnestness of truth
thought Paul, as he led the way with Miss Mary Mutlow
silence may often be
called "iron"), but at last he inquired
he said, putting it as mildly as he could with any
accuracy
he asked, with more cordiality than he had
spoken for a long time
said Paul, overjoyed at being so thoroughly understood
said Mr. Blinkhorn, holding up one hand
cried Paul rudely (he was so
disgusted at the suggestion
he piped shrilly in Paul's ear
grumbled little Porter, the boy in question
said Paul, with great disgust, for he had thought Mrs. Grimstone a
woman of better taste
he
said, briskly and cheerfully
he said in his squeaky voice
he cried, pretending to recollect it
he added with judicial impartiality
said Siggers, alarmed at the threatened loss of his
dignity
said Mr. Bultitude, wriggling with embarrassment
said the Doctor, looking up from his marmalade
said the Doctor, with some reason
said the Doctor at last
he said, retreating a step or two
protested Dulcie, only too willing to be
convinced of her boy-lover's constancy
said a jarring, sneering voice close by
wailed poor Dulcie piteously, clinging to
the reluctant Paul
he said
with a sickly attempt at jocularity which delighted none
said Tipping,
exasperated by the sight of Dulcie's emotion
suggested Biddlecomb, as if he were proposing a testimonial
he
added, turning suddenly upon the unlucky Paul
all of
which several took down most industriously
there was much difference of opinion as to the
manner of spelling the "Teutonian Shakespeare
the irreverent
youth always spoke of Mrs. Grimstone in this way
he said, very injudiciously for his
purpose
and with a plain one is called
said the Doctor, not relishing
the war being carried into his own country
he began, in a cautious, oily tone
began Paul, with dignity, when he had closed the glass door
behind him
said the angry Mr.
Bultitude
he said as he entered
said Paul, in a high state of
irritation
he told
himself at last
he began, in rather a trembling voice
said Biddlecomb, quite broken down
Mr. Bultitude had in
satisfying their alarm taken care to let them know his private opinion
of them, which was not flattering
said Paul, not caring to undeceive him
said the latter, after a long minute, in
which a little skeleton clock on the mantelpiece ticked loudly
he
went on, with a gulp (he never could quite overcome a repulsion to the
boy
said Chawner, with an odious side smirk of
triumph at Paul, who, quite crushed by the horror of the situation, had
collapsed feebly on his chair again
he
thundered, pacing restlessly up and down the room in his excitement,
till Paul felt very like Daniel, without his sense of security
said the Doctor, more briskly
said the Doctor, who was standing at his
writing-table in an attitude
began the Doctor in an impressive bass
the Doctor on occasions like these
never spared his best epithets, and Paul soon began to feel himself a
very villain
continued the Doctor, now allowing his powerful voice to boom to
its full compass
said the Doctor, when they were outside
he said with a grin
said Mr. Bultitude, with ponderous sarcasm
said Paul, in a broken voice, for, wild as the threat was, he
could not afford to despise it after his experiences of the stone's
power
said the Doctor, slightly shocked at this
coarse way of putting things
Dick showed a painful inclination to giggle here
and he
wagged his head reprovingly at his disgusted father, who longed to
denounce his hypocrisy, but dared not
explained Dick, with a perilous approach to digging the other
in the ribs
said Dick, feeling that he had made a mistake
he went on, gradually
overcoming his first nervousness
said Dick at last, after a long look at all the old familiar
objects
he added in a lower tone to his father, who was standing by,
inexpressibly pained and disgusted by his utter want of dignity
said the man, with a rather peculiar intonation
said Paul desperately, without very well knowing what he said
said Paul, casting about for some explanation of
his appearance
said Paul briskly, very grateful for the permission
said Mr. Bultitude in a hollow voice
said Tommy, whose relief probably
softened his temper
said Tommy, very slowly, and reluctantly
went on Tommy, very slowly, as if struggling with the
remnants of a conscience
of some one who had only been "writing" a
year and was doing seven thousand a week, of losses they had been
and of the uselessness of
said the Doctor, quite as angrily
said the guard at last
said the guard at last to the Doctor, as he withdrew
they said, when they recovered breath
said the one who was called Goldicutt, and who was a jovial old
gentleman with a pink face and white whiskers
said the latter, peering curiously in
he said, to Paul (whom they had managed
during the journey to brush and scrape into something approaching
respectability
said Mr. Goldicutt, as he put Paul
into a cab, and pressed half-a-sovereign into his unwilling hand
said cook, with some pride, when she had finished
Eliza having apparently tossed
her head
here Paul shivered with
shame
he said at last, with a dubious smile, which
showed a row of very white teeth
Paradine assented with a loud laugh
began Mr. Bultitude in great embarrassment
said his brother-in-law politely
he said at last, with a swift, keen glance at Paul, who sat
anxiously waiting for his next words
said Paul, willing to make all reasonable concessions
thought Paul, who had been getting uncomfortable
said Paradine a little impatiently
as Dick
made a sudden movement towards his white waistcoat
said Dick obstinately; he was fumbling all the time irresolutely
in his pockets
said poor Mr. Bultitude, disgusted at this exhibition of
selfishness
said Paul, trying to pass (which, as Roly persisted in leaping
joyously from side to side of the narrow stair, was difficult
said his father, hoarse and panting
said Paul, with a
vivid recollection of the exploring stick
said the Doctor, sincerely
enough
cried Paul, with a well-executed start
cried Paul, who saw the conveniences of this theory
said Marmaduke, under his breath
he said,
in a furious aside
said Paradine, without showing much surprise at the failure
of so very forlorn a hope
said Mr. Bultitude, in answer to the look
said Dick, looking rather puzzled, but seeing that he was
expected to agree
the Doctor made an inarticulate protest, while Dick
stared, incredulous
he said in a choked voice
he added, in a lower
tone
