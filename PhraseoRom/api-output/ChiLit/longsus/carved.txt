my father used to say
I said suddenly, catching his arm
she said with a smile
Mrs. Selwood wrote to mamma
I half said, half whispered
she said to father, when she was telling him all
about it
and she pointed to me
she called out loudly to a girl of fourteen
or fifteen
she went on in a lower
voice
it was before the days of
or "cabinet"
photographs; this picture was what was called a "daguerreotype" on
glass, and had been taken on purpose for me at some expense
I said through my tears
I said to myself unselfishly
one of the other
teachers called her -- and put the two together
said her sister at last
I went on,
more and more excitedly
said Harriet; but all the same I think she
understood me better than she could express, for she kissed me and said
I said, as I took the book
said Miss Ledbury sadly but sternly
she said, and her voice was not unkind
she was a good-natured girl
I said quite calmly, as if there was nothing the least out of
the common in all this
said my conductor or steed, I don't know which to call
him
I exclaimed, as I hugged her
I said among my tears
he began, looking at me with a rather odd smile
said Myra -- she often called me "little" though
she was _scarcely_ any taller than I
Myra spoke as if she was now
a very big girl indeed
she whispered, by way of giving me something pleasant to
think of, perhaps
I said in the same tone
I went on, after a moment or two
