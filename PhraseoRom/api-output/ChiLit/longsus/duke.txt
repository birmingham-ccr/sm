And
Richard was beginning to act over again the whole scene of the deer-hunt,
but Fru, that is to say, Lady Astrida, was too busy to listen, and broke
in with
said Richard, but half understanding her
said Richard, in a low voice, playing with the clasp of his
father's belt, and looking down
and trying to silence the hounds;
and Richard running to Sir Eric, cried
said the Baron de Centeville; and being answered by a
mournful look and sigh from Ferrieres, he too bent before the boy, and
repeated the words
proceeded the Norman, clenching his hands, and
speaking between his teeth
said the priest, pointing to the large Cross over the Altar
answered Richard's young, trembling voice
said Duke Alan, as Richard rose up, startled
exclaimed Abbot Martin, bursting into tears, as
he finished his narration
cried Richard, jumping out of his chair of state, and
running up to him
said he to Richard, in French
proceeded the Norman, in his own tongue
whispered Alberic, as he began hastily to dress himself
said Dame Astrida, holding out her arms
said he, sadly, after a silence; then looking at her in
wonder
he cried, starting back in amazement
or as it had become shortened
called back Osmond, after a moment
the Norman
war-cry, joined with
cried Sir Eric, with a long breath, as if relieved of
half his anxieties
returned Bernard the Dane, solemnly
said the King, raising him in his arms and kissing him
replied the old Dane,
cautiously
said the Count, in his native tongue, when
Richard had crossed from the King's side, and stood beside him
said the Count, in an undertone
said Osmond, seeing a broad portly old man, with grey

answered Richard, with equal gravity
and Carloman sunk his voice
exclaimed Richard, expecting to be obeyed as
he was at home; but Lothaire only laughed scornfully, saying
said he,

said Gerberge, coldly, to Richard
whispered Richard, edging himself close to the Count, and
trying to reach his ear

at the foot of the steps, he kissed the hand which his young Duke held
out to him
began
Walter -- but a very different tone exclaimed from behind the pilgrim
cried Walter, extremely distressed; but Richard had caught hold of the

cried Richard, leaping up in the
delicious cool evening breeze
said Osmond to the first
