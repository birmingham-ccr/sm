she said, on the day I bade her adieu
cried a broad-shouldered jack-tar, giving the fluke of the
anchor a hearty slap with his hand after the housing was
completed
cried Jack Martin, giving me a slap on the shoulder,
the day I joined the ship
cried Peterkin, with an
impudent wink of his eye
said the captain to the men
said Jack Martin, in a grave tone, to me and Peterkin, as we
stood on the quarterdeck awaiting our fate
said Jack, pressing me gently backward
said Jack, assuming a grave expression of
countenance, which I observed always had the effect of checking
Peterkin's disposition to make fun of everything
said Jack, taking me by the arm
and hurrying forward
said Jack, after we had laid it on the stone which contained
our little all
said he, with a rueful look
replied Jack, with a smile
cried Peterkin, stopping short and grasping his club with both
hands
returned Jack, quietly
squeezing Peterkin's hat over his eyes
said Peterkin, with a grave, patronizing expression
of countenance, patting his tall companion on the shoulder
said Jack, in a voice of sympathy
cried Jack, in a quick, suppressed voice
said Peterkin with a sneer
said Jack, in a low whisper
exclaimed Jack, slapping him on the shoulder when he
came up
said he, pointing to the pig's ear
cried I, laying my hand on his shoulder
said Peterkin, with a suppressed laugh
said Peterkin, coming up to me
cried Peterkin, waving his hand
he added, pointing to the sides of the tank, which, for the
space of two inches above the water-level, were incrusted with salt
said Peterkin, who had been gravely attentive to this
off-hand advice
exclaimed Peterkin, drawing a long breath
cried Peterkin, one morning about three weeks after our
return from our long excursion
answered Jack, throwing down the axe with which he was just about
to proceed towards the boat
replied Jack, with a smile
said I, interrupting their conversation
cried Jack, going up to the
bower for his bow and arrows
returned Jack, stripping off his clothes
said Jack, when we were composed enough to listen to him
said I, going up to him
cried Peterkin, seizing the axe
said Peterkin, turning his head a little on one side
continued Peterkin, after a pause
replied Jack, laughing, as we entered the bower
cried Peterkin, as we all assisted to drag the boat above
high-water mark
said Jack, as he shouldered the
oars
cried Peterkin, resting on his oar and wiping his heated brow
cried Peterkin as we came in sight of it
he continued, pointing with a look of resignation to the shore
said Peterkin, in an excited tone
he said, as the boat
flew before the wind
cried Jack, in a quick, earnest tone
said Peterkin, beginning to feel cheery again
said I, as we gained the shelter of the bushes
said Jack in a hoarse whisper
said Jack, pushing us aside, as we stooped
over the poor woman and endeavoured to restore her
said he, opening his eyes and looking
up after some trouble
cried Jack, starting up and seizing the man
by the arm
said he,
turning with a sad expression of countenance to Peterkin
said Jack, in a solemn tone
cried Peterkin, starting up, and grasping Jack convulsively
by the arm
he said, with a Sardonic smile, while I felt his grasp
tighten on my shoulder
said I, in a low voice
said I, shaking my clenched fist in his face
said I, in a loud voice, while I felt the blood
rush to my temples
said the first speaker, with an oath
said he, looking me full in the face
he added, laying his finger on the chart
said Bill,
looking down again into the sea
said Bill, in a voice so deep that it startled me
said Bill, lowering his voice
answered the man with the swallow-tail
said a man with a deep scar over his right eye
he added, lowering his
voice
thought I, gazing in horror at the captain, who, with a quiet
look of indifference, leaned upon the taffrail smoking a cigar and
contemplating the fertile green islets as they passed like a lovely
picture before our eyes
he continued, in
a soliloquising voice
said Bill, his lip curling with contempt
he continued, after a pause, during which we
walked in silence towards the spot where we had left our comrades
said Bill, in a
deep, sad voice
said Bill, when the chief had ceased to talk
said he, with a wave of the hand
said the captain, in a low voice
his voice assumed a slightly sneering tone as he said this
added Bill with a smile that for the first time seemed
to me to be mingled with good-natured cheerfulness
whispered the captain, as he walked along the line of men,
who were all armed to the teeth
whispered the mate, as the
men stepped out
said I, with deep anxiety
he exclaimed, on awaking suddenly, after a slumber of an hour
I added, seeing that he turned his head away
said I, cheerfully, sitting down beside him on the
deck
said my companion, in a faint voice, looking anxiously into
my face
said I, in deep compassion
said I, in a low voice
cried Bill, starting up on his elbow
said Bill, opening his eves
said Bill, in a faint voice
resumed Jack, with a smile
he said, at the end of a
long consultation on the subject
said Jack, as we seated ourselves beside him on the cabin
sky-light
pointing to Peterkin and
me
said the teacher, as he followed Jack to the cabin
he cried to the half dozen of
natives who stood upon the deck, gazing in wonder at all they saw
replied the teacher, with a smile
he said,
waving his hand around him
he added, looking earnestly into our faces
he said,
looking around with a smile, while a tear of gratitude trembled in his
eye and rolled down his coal-black cheek
said Jack, turning abruptly towards us, and buttoning up his
jacket as he spoke
said he, turning to Jack
said Jack, as we were about to step into our little boat
said the teacher, shaking his head
cried Jack, on beholding this horrible tragedy
he exclaimed with
flashing eye
whispered the teacher, in a voice of deep
emotion, while he seized Jack by the arm
cried Jack, raising himself, and tossing back his hair wildly
he
said, with a bitter smile
he added, looking at Jack
with a peculiar smile
added
Jack, looking seriously into the teacher's face
said Peterkin in a whisper, as he stepped upon the beach
whispered Jack to the teacher
he cried, heaving a deep, long-drawn sigh
he added, with a grave, meditative look
said Jack,
quietly, as he tossed the hind legs (including the tail) of a cold roast
pig to his comrade
said Tararo, turning to the teacher
replied Jack, in a tremulous voice
said Peterkin, with a heavy sigh
he said, cutting our bonds
repeated the teacher, shaking us warmly by the hands again
and again
said Jack, as we mingled with the crowd
said Peterkin, endeavouring to wink, but he
had wept so much of late, poor fellow, that he found it difficult
