the object of this volume is, to describe
said Major Graham one day
said Major Graham, looking very sly one morning
replied she in great alarm
cried Harry, in an ecstacy of delight
answered Charles, hastening on faster than
ever, while he grasped the precious loaf more firmly in his hand, and
limped along at a prodigious rate
said she, holding up her head, and trying to look very
dignified
answered Peter, laughing, while the impudent boy took a cup
of milk, and drank it off, saying
cried she, at the full pitch of her voice
said
Harry, colouring perfectly scarlet
answered Laura, bursting into
tears and sobbing with grief
said Major Graham,
pretending to be very hungry, and looking slyly at Laura
answered Mrs.
Crabtree, helping Lady Harriet into bed, after which she closed the
shutters, put out the candles, and left the room, angrily muttering
cried Harry, opening the bundle
said uncle David, one morning
answered Laura, as seriously as if she had never thought of this
before
cried Laura, panting for breath, while she looked both
frightened and fatigued
answered Harry, gasping and trying not
to tumble for the twentieth time
said Charles Forrester, reaching him
one of his tarts
answered the impudent boy, demolishing every thing he could get; and it
is believed that Peter ate, on this memorable occasion, three times more
than any other person, as each of the party offered him something, and
he never was heard to say
answered Peter, casting a devouring eye upon it
continued Laura, when Mr. Harwood had
again tied it up in the towel
said she, in spite of what grandmama taught her
exclaimed Harry, staring with astonishment
replied Captain Digby, stepping up,
close to the holly-bush, and peeping over
replied Laura, with tears in her eyes
whispered Laura, crushing her way
in between his chair and Miss Perceval's
cried she, trembling all over
said Harry, after she had a little recovered from her fright,
and was walking slowly homewards, while she cast an alarmed glance
frequently behind, thinking she still heard the bull in pursuit
added Lord Rockville, looking very grand and contemptuous
cried Laura, when they arrived from
Holiday House
exclaimed Harry and Laura, each seizing
hold of a hand
and shook his
head in a most serious manner after they were concluded, saying
cried Harry and Laura, in an ecstacy of delight, and
as they each had a knee of uncle David's, which belonged to themselves,
they scrambled into their places, exclaiming
said the fairy Teach-all, speaking with a very sweet
smile, and a soft, pleasing voice
interrupted the fairy Do-nothing,
rudely pushing her companion aside, with an angry contemptuous look
remarked Major Graham, when he pointed them out to his
young companions
asked Frank, as they proceeded along the street
cried Harry,
turning eagerly round
said Peter Grey, who was going to join the Thunderbolt, in
about a fortnight afterwards
said Mrs. Crabtree, with more than usual
kindness
continued
Frank, in the kindest manner
said Major Graham, who had joined them some moments
before
said Frank, taking her hand affectionately, and trying to
look cheerful
said Frank, in a low and broken voice
said Major Graham, trying to be cheerful
exclaimed Harry, clapping his hands
said Lady Rockville, looking gravely at his enraged
countenance
said Major Graham, one day
whispered Harry, in a tone of breathless
amazement
asked
Laura, making an effort to recover her voice, and speaking in a tone of
deep anxiety
said Harry, taking her kindly by
the hand
thought Laura, while she
glanced from Miss Perceval's round, red bustling face, to the poor
suffering maid, who became worse and worse during the day, for there
came on what sailors call
which gradually rose to a
or, what the passengers considered a hurricane; and,
towards night, it attained the dignity of a real undeniable
whispered he, looking doubtfully
at Laura's pallid countenance
added
Laura, clinging to Major Graham, when he entered the room
said Frank,
one night, when he felt rather easier; and next morning, Laura invited
poor Teddy Collins to walk up stairs, who looked exceedingly astonished,
though very much pleased at the proposal, saying
exclaimed Mrs. Crabtree, getting into a rage
said Frank languidly, raising his eyes
said Laura one day, several months after their return
home
