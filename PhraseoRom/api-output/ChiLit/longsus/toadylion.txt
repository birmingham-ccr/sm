he said on one occasion
said Priscilla, the pride of successful achievement swelling
in her breast
the prone but gallant General was
proceeding to declare in the face of Priscilla's horrified
protestations that he mustn't speak so, when a slow heavy step was
heard on the other side of the hedge, and a deep voice uttered the
single syllable
when he fired off his
cannon, and
just as, in moments of affection, she would still speak to
them of
began Priscilla, fingering nervously the frill of the torn pinafore
about her throat
muttered Hugh John, who was a stickler for accuracy
continued Priscilla, gaining confidence from a certain curious
spark of light which began to burn steadily in her father's eyes
shouted Hugh John, with sudden fierceness
said Priscilla, who had no such scruples as to telling on her
enemies
at this point Priscilla began
to talk by the book, the dignity of the epic tale working on her
cried the namesake of that hero
Priscilla was crying in good earnest
now
Priscilla went on spasmodically between her tears
cried Janet, who went about her work all day
with one ear cocked toward the chamber of her brave sick soldier
said General-Field-Marshal Smith to the oracle
said his father, with a little wave of his hand
said the Chief Constable of Bordershire
said the General in a low, hissing whisper
said General-Field-Marshal Smith grandly
cried the under-keeper gruffly
said Tom, saluting gravely and turning off across the
lawn towards the
was how the royal exile pronounced it
But at the first drill, upon General Peter issuing some complicated
order, such as
said his father, shaking his finger at him in a
solemnising manner
commented Toady Lion in his shrill
high pipe, which cuts through all other conversation as easily as a
sharp knife cleaves a bar of soap
said Prissy in a shocked voice
shouted the Smoutchy fighting tail
that was what Hugh John
said, quoting (partly) from the
said Hugh John, explanatorily afterwards
this he considered a Christian name
and surname, curious but quite authoritative
said Hugh John indignantly to
himself
cried Janet, clasping her hands in
devout thankfulness
he said, swinging his wet legs
concluded Sammy Carter, summing the matter up philosophically
he said, changing the venue of the argument
Hugh John's voice was distinctly ironical
he demanded in his quick way
he said to Mrs. Baker, in the impressive tone in which he
addressed public meetings
muttered Cissy, as she went upstairs
he said to Mrs. Carter
he said, after a moment's pause to consider whether
the daughter of a magistrate was to be trusted
said the owner of the dog
laughed Cissy Carter, sitting down beside
Toady Lion
said the small boy wistfully
said Toady Lion, unmoved, arranging his cannon
all over again on a new plan after the removal of Cissy's foot
said Hugh John, nodding his head vehemently
cried the piping voice of Toady Lion,
suddenly appearing through the shrubbery (his own more excellent form
was "scrubbery"), with his arms full of the new brass cannons
said Hugh John, with dignity
said Cissy, thrusting out her
upper lip with an expression of bitter reproach and disappointment
said Cissy, when peace had been restored in this
manner, and they were wandering amicably across the back meadow where
they could not be seen from the house windows, taking alternate sucks
at a stick of brown toffee with crumbs stuck firmly on it, the
property of Cissy
he
added hastily, moving off a little
she whispered, with a soft light in her
eyes
she looked at him again yet more wistfully, still
holding him by the hand which had last passed over the mutual
joint-stock candy-stick
said Hugh John, and turning on his heel he went into
the stable without even saying
said his sister softly, so as not to waken Hugh
John
grumbled Toady Lion, turning over and over three or
four times very fast till he had all the bed-clothes wrapped about him
like a cocoon
said Prissy gently, to tempt him
grumbled Toady Lion, who knew well the strength of
his position, and was as troublesome as a _prima donna_ when she knows
her manager cannot do without her
said the Obstinate Brat -- as Janet, happily inspired,
had once called him after being worsted in an argument
she said, telling the tale afterwards
said Prissy, almost in tears
said Toady Lion unsympathetically,
trying to find pockets in Prissy's night-gown
he said with the
hesitation of one who stops to think what he is going to say
cried the girl indignantly after him
he panted, in tremulous haste to tell some fell
tidings
cried
Janet Sheepshanks, as the boy retreated precipitately through the open
French window
said the generous hero of battles instantly
cried Nosie Cuthbertson, performing another yet more painful
twist
replied Prissy, with woman's gentle wit avoiding all
discussion of the bone of contention
said the elder of the two captors, one Joe Craig, the son of
the Carlisle carrier
returned the great chief, swiftly deciding upon an
alternative plan, as if he had thought about it from the first
he cried in a burst
she cried from her watch-tower among the whins
said his sister, gently taking him by the
hand
growled Toady Lion, stamping his little foot in
impotent wrath
explained Toady
Lion readily but somewhat unaccurately
she went a little nearer to him and stroked the cuff of his
coat-sleeve
she answered, taking courage from a certain look in Mr.
Smith's eyes
said Prissy, for whom there was
no other of the name
answered the senior bailie, still more hilariously
said one of the councillors generously, when the plate was
proposed
he said, speaking slowly as if he were thinking hard between
the words
he remarked casually to Hugh John, as he went past the front
door with an armful of hay for bedding
protested the hero, in despair
said Hugh John to himself
said Hugh John to himself
said the young man with the cane, superciliously stroking his
maligned upper lip
ejaculated Hugh John, doubling his fist
said Prissy, with sweetest resignation
cried Mr. Carling patronisingly, as Hugh John came
up, modestly swinging his bat as if he did as much every day of his
life
