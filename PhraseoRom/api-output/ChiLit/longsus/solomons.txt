as she righted herself
after a roll
called out somebody who was sitting near me
said Sir Henry Curtis, when the man had brought the
whisky and lit the lamp
all the world was dark
I said, much put out, and pocketing my
paper -- for I do not like to be thought one of those silly fellows who
consider it witty to tell lies, and who are for ever boasting to
newcomers of extraordinary hunting adventures which never happened
I said, sitting down again
said Sir Henry, who had been giving me his most
serious attention
and then added, with a glance at the white man's great stature and
breadth
bush as the natives call it, and
in some places, with the
said Good -- for I am sorry to say he had a habit of using
strong language when excited -- contracted, no doubt, in the course of
his nautical career
he said to me innocently, when I
expressed my astonishment at the fact
answered the Zulu -- I always called him a
Zulu, though he was not really one
said Sir Henry presently, in his deep voice
I said angrily to Ventvogel
he said, with a sigh of relief
he went on,
stooping down to pick up a queerly-shaped bone scraped at the end into
a sharp point
said Sir Henry in a low voice
said Sir Henry, after inspecting this ancient work of art
said Good, surveying these shining-leaved trees with evident
enthusiasm
I answered, speaking very
slowly, so that he might understand me
asked the old man solemnly
put in the old gentleman
said the old man in supplication
remarked the old gentleman, in a tone of intense relief
he said, in a magniloquent voice
he said, pointing to the mountains known among
the Kukuanas as the
he answered with a shrug
he put in, in Zulu
piped out a thin voice which seemed to come from
the monkey in the shade
piped out the thin voice
that proceeded from the monkey-like figure
pointing to Infadoos and
Scragga, who, young villain that he was, was employed in cleaning the
blood of the soldier off his spear
and he pointed to the opposite
side of the kraal
and I held up the Winchester repeater
and she
pointed her skinny finger at Umbopa
said Ignosi to Sir Henry
said Sir Henry, with a sigh
I said to the others
Twala cried, as we came up
piped Gagool, in her thin piercing voice
pointing to the
ominous group of executioners behind
I called out, rising from my seat
pointing
to the long rows of corpses
said Sir Henry, as we sat down, having first lit a lamp of the
sort used by the Kukuanas, of which the wick is made from the fibre of
a species of palm leaf, and the oil from clarified hippopotamus fat
was Umbopa's answer, when I had translated
pointing to the row of chiefs
said Infadoos, when he had done
answered the old chief with a smile, which was
reflected on the faces of his companions
said the old chief, still smiling a little
said Ignosi, so soon as they were gone
and he pointed round him
said I, restraining my indignation with difficulty
and he
pointed towards the three distant peaks
cried Scragga in high glee
answered the girl, in trembling accents
and she pointed to the peaks
whispered Sir Henry to me
he cried, as he came
and here he rose and pointed towards the dense mass of our
foes
answered our quondam servant, who now, clad as he was
in the full panoply of savage war, looked every inch a warrior king
and
also before the sight of Twala's overpowering force caused the hearts
of our soldiers
said Sir Henry, his deep voice shaking a
little
ended old Infadoos, pointing to Ignosi
like his
Berserkir forefathers, and the blow went crashing through shield and
spear, through head-dress, hair, and skull, till at last none would of
their own will come near the great white
said Infadoos calmly, as between the intervals of binding a
wound on his arm he surveyed what remained to him of his corps
he said, with bitter mockery
and he pointed
with his battle-axe towards the setting orb
said Ignosi, laying his hand
affectionately on Sir Henry's arm
or council, and was formally recognised as king by the
she shrieked in terror and fury
she said, projecting her hideous
shrivelled countenance between the grass curtains, and fixing her
gleaming eyes upon us
I said, pointing to the strata of stiff blue clay which
were yet to be seen among the grass and bushes that clothed the sides
of the pit
and I pointed to a series of worn flat slabs of stone that were placed
on a gentle slope below the level of a watercourse which in some past
age had been cut out of the solid rock
said Sir Henry, who is a scholar, having taken a high degree in
classics at college
said I faintly, at last
said I, in a low voice -- somehow one did not dare to
speak above a whisper in that place
said Gagool, advancing into the
doorway
I asked, breathless with interest as we all were
she said, holding the light before her
she said, after a pause
said Sir Henry, with a hard little laugh
said Sir Henry's voice at last, and it sounded awful in the
intense stillness
he said presently, in a constrained sort of
voice
he said, so soon as we had picked
ourselves up and got our breath
he said, between his gasps
said Ignosi bitterly, and with flashing eyes
said Sir Henry that night, as we sat by our fire and
gazed up at the beetling cliffs above us
burst out Sir Henry at last
was the
answer, spoken in the hesitating voice of a man who has had little
recent opportunity of using his tongue
said George Curtis, when I showed him some of the diamonds
