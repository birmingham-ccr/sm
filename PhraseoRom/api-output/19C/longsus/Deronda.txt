said Mrs. Davilow, and entering the hall, she said to the housekeeper who came forward
said Gwendolen, in a strongly remonstrant tone, turning away from the glass with an air of vexation
emendations of Greek texts -- said nearly at the same time
said young Clintock, the archdeacon's classical son, who had been so fortunate as to take her to dinner, and came up to renew conversation as soon as Herr Klesmer's performance was ended
said Gwendolen, provisionally; then she added, with decision
said Gwendolen, hastily, a quick blush spreading over her face and neck
here Rex bit his lips and felt the tears starting, to his great vexation; then he rallied and tried to say more firmly
said Gwendolen, kissing her merrily, and passing over the question of the fears which Mrs. Davilow had meant to account for
with a correct look of anxiety such as elated mortals try to super-induce when their pulses are all the while quick with triumph; and Mrs. Davilow, in the same moment, uttered a low
she added, looking with a grave nod at Mr. Gascoigne
said Mr. Gascoigne, in a judicious tone of rational advice to a person understood to be altogether rational
and Mrs. Davilow had told Alice to go and see if her sister were come down, adding
she said, the tears coming with her words when the door had closed
said the elegant Grecian, who had been paying her assiduous attention
said Gwendolen, with a light laugh
said Lord Brackenshaw, in a tone of careless dismissal, adding quickly
the rector was just then crossing at a little distance with Gwendolen on his arm, and turned in compliance with the call
said Lord Brackenshaw, good-humoredly; then taking out his watch and looking at Mrs. Arrowpoint again
Why are you so cruel to us all
said Klesmer, suddenly dropping from his quick narrative to a reflective tone, with an impressive frown
said Gwendolen looking at her card
said Gwendolen, in a deprecating tone
was the answer with which she tried to quiet herself; for she could not imagine Gwendolen under the influence of any feeling which would make her satisfied in what we traditionally call
he said, in a fatherly way, moving a chair for her as he held her hand
said Gwendolen, with some sauciness
he said, rising also, and speaking with benignant gravity
said Daniel, with firm distinctness
and then added dreamily, after a like pause
her words were broken by rising sobs
said Mrs. Meyrick, starting up
Deronda went on, after giving his brief narrative
cried Mab, clasping her hands and stooping toward Mirah's feet, as she entered the parlor
said Mrs. Meyrick, with rapid decisiveness
said Mrs. Davilow, trying to smile, and putting her hand on Gwendolen's as she added, mournfully
Mrs. Davilow had become frightened and hesitating
here her tone took an edge of scorn
said Klesmer, going to seat himself at the piano, and touching the keys so as to give with the delicacy of an echo in the far distance a melody which he had set to Heine's
said Mrs. Arrowpoint, with a rather contemptuous stateliness
said Mr. Arrowpoint, when Catherine was gone
here Gwendolen became a little more nervous
Gwendolen resumed, turning from pale to pink and back again
said Klesmer, again pausing near the piano
said Klesmer, turning toward her and speaking with a slight increase of accent
here Gwendolen looked as if she were going to speak, but Klesmer lifted up his hand and said, decisively
here Klesmer frowned and shook his fingers as if to dismiss a triviality
said Gwendolen, rather haughtily -- then, checking herself, she added in another tone
said Gwendolen, with a sense of wincing rather than of being refuted
said gentle Mrs. Davilow, entering
she began, glancing over the upper layer
said Gwendolen, in a hard tone; and Mrs. Davilow was silent, thinking as she had often thought before
said innocent Lady Mallinger, misled by Grandcourt's languid seriousness
said Grandcourt, looking round at Lush and fixing him with narrow eyes
said Lush, rising with his hands in his pockets, and feeling some latent venom still within him
said Mrs. Davilow, in the tone of one corrected, turning to sit down and take up a bit of work that lay at hand
said Mrs. Davilow, observing that Gwendolen leaned back in her chair after taking the pen in her hand
she was marking off the items on her fingers, and paused on the fourth while she added
she went on, drawing down her mamma's face to caress it with her own cheeks
said Gwendolen, rather afraid of herself
she said, taking up her work again
said Grandcourt, with his shadow of a smile
said Gwendolen with a little air of
he resumed, playing with his whisker, and at first not looking at her
Grandcourt replied, in a lower tone
said Grandcourt, just audibly, turning to face her
said Mirah, shaking her head with decisive gravity
said Deronda, wishing that it were less so; then, not to let the opportunity escape
Mirah had changed her voice a little in each of these words and had given them a loving intonation
said Mab, who had hitherto kept a modest silence, and now spoke bashfully, as was her wont in the presence of Prince Camaralzaman
here she turned so as to take all three of her companions in one glance
here Deronda hesitated in his turn
says a Rabbi, by way of indisputable instance
and then with a familiar nod and smile, said
said Deronda, with a preoccupied air
said he, carrying on the subject that he might have an excuse for addressing Mordecai, to whom he turned and said
he added, with a certain drop in his voice to a lower, more familiar nasal
said Lady Pentreath, an easy, deep- voiced old lady
said Sir Hugo, glancing at Deronda; and then turning his face toward Gwendolen, he said less audibly
added the baronet, lowering his voice
said Gwendolen, passing over this compliment with a chill smile
said Gwendolen, speaking with determination
said Sir Hugo, in a tone of confidential assent
said Sir Hugo, glancing at Deronda
he added, looking at Lady Mallinger
here he looked at Gwendolen
she said, with some gayety
said Gwendolen, composedly, pointing to the turquoises, while she still held the glass
said Deronda promptly, with a touch of indignant severity, which he was inclined to encourage as his own safeguard
said Deronda, with strong emphasis
said Hans, after the first hearty greetings and inquiries
said Hans, his face creasing drolly
said Hans, putting touches to his picture
said Hans, looking at it rather contemptuously
said Mirah, full of her subject
said Mrs. Meyrick, keeping to herself the next clause
said the rational Amy, having a half-holiday from her teaching
here Deronda smiled at Mirah
she said, looking at Mrs. Meyrick
and all we're smiling over the
said Klesmer, with a playful nod
said Mab, with a magnanimous air
said Hans, with a considering air
here she looked at Hans
said Mirah, looking doubtfully at Mrs. Meyrick, who in her turn looked up at her son, and said
and when they were riding he added
Mordecai had pathetically pressed his hand upon his breast, and then stretched its wasted fingers out before him
Mordecai had taken a step nearer as he spoke, and now laid his hand on Deronda's arm with a tight grasp; his face little more than a foot off had something like a pale flame in it -- an intensity of reliance that acted as a peremptory claim, while he went on
here Cohen pointed to his own forehead
said Pash, his dark face lighting up rather impishly
said Buchan, in a rapid thin Scotch tone which was like the letting in of a little cool air on the conversation
Here Mordecai lifted his eyes suddenly, laid his hand on Deronda's arm, and said
here Mordecai again rested his hand on Deronda's arm, and looked at him with that joy of the hectic patient which pierces us to sadness
said Gwendolen, as she laid down her hat and seated herself next to her mother; and then looking at her with a playfully monitory air
said Mr. Gascoigne, in a kind of cordial advice
said Gwendolen, arranging her hat fastidiously
here she glanced upward to that higher power rather archly, and continued
said Mirah, in a new tone of feeling
said Deronda, looking at her coolly
Jacob, who had profited by the family remarks, went up to his knee and said
said Deronda, pinching the lad's ear
said Jacob, performing a dance of triumph with his small scarlet legs, while he took various objects out of the deep pockets of his knickerbockers and returned them thither, as a slight hint of his resources; after which, running to the door of the workroom, he opened it wide, set his back against it, and said
Deronda went on gently, after a pause
Deronda went on wishing to make the disclosure gradual; but noticing a shrinking movement in Mordecai, he added
Cohen here threw some additional emphasis into his look and tone
said the grandmother, with a sigh of resignation
he added, turning with a look of amused enlightenment to Deronda
Hans went on, walking about with his hands thrust into the pockets of his brown velveteen coat
bending to kiss her brow in a hasty, desperate manner, and condescendingly, on his way to the door
echoed Gwendolen, playing at sauciness
she added, having devoured her mortification
exclaimed Gwendolen, reddening and looking at him again, overcome by startled wonder, and unable to reflect on the probable falsity of the phrase
said Mirah, wondering at the changed expression and manner of the
said Gwendolen, putting her hand on Mirah's, and speaking hardly above a whisper
in a hurried whisper, then rose, and added, with only a hazy consciousness
was her first darting determination; then
was the bitter refrain of her rebellious dreams
said the princess, with proud impetuosity
here her tone changed to one of a more bitter incisiveness
she pointed with her forefinger to her breast
she spread out her hands, palm upward, on each side of her, as she paused with a bitter compression of her lip, then let her voice fall into muffled, rapid utterance
she spread out her hands again
she said, with a sudden return of impetuosity
said Mrs. Meyrick not without divination
continued Mrs. Meyrick, turning again to Anna
said Anna, beginning with a virtuous intention of repressing her own sentiments; but then, unable to resist a rare occasion for speaking them freely, she went on
she answered, with a deprecating movement of her arm
here she held her left hand a yard from the floor
there was an involuntary movement of indignation in Deronda's voice
said Deronda, saddened more and more
said the mother, with a bitter melancholy
she added in a deeper tone
said Deronda, in a tone of authority
said Deronda, in a deep, shaken voice
here her voice sank almost to a whisper close to Deronda's ear
and that full glance in its intense mournfulness seemed to say
just shrinking together and changing his attitude a little, Then he had gathered resolution enough to say clearly
she added, turning toward him
and the amiable Alice did not mind what the Jews believed, she was sure she
She paused an instant, and then began again
said Sir Hugo, with a flippancy which was an escape of some vexation hidden under his more serious speech
said Kalonymos, looking at his watch
said Kalonymos, shaking his head with a compassionate smile
said Mab, with what was really a sister's tenderness cunningly disguised
putting out his hand with an appealing look of penitence, she met the look with melancholy gentleness, and said
continued Mordecai, looking at Hans
he said once, after a long silence
said Mirah, with low-toned intensity
Lapidoth had quickly conceived that he must guard against something unlikely, yet possible
said Mirah again, looking full at the keen face which was turned toward hers
said Lapidoth, speaking in a lowered tone
Mirah ended with difficulty, her heart throbbing
he said, in the old caressing way
said Lapidoth, almost turning on his heel away from this pale, trembling daughter, who seemed now to have got the inconvenient world to back her; but he quickly turned on it again, with his hands feeling about restlessly in his pockets, and said, with some return to his appealing tone
Deronda went on, enjoying one of those rare moments when our yearnings and our acts can be completely one, and the real we behold is our ideal good
but he immediately checked himself, and added
said Sir Hugo, in his comfortable way
said Gwendolen, not long after the rector's communication
said Deronda, and then feeling that the word was cold, he added, correctively
said Hans, curtly, throwing down his palette with the air of one who has begun to feign by mistake; then pushing forward a chair for Deronda, he threw himself into another, and leaned backward with his hands behind his head, while he went on
said Hans, creasing his face into a smile
said Hans, in a flighty way
said Deronda, hurt by the idea that Hans suspected him of insincerity, and giving an offended emphasis to his words
he went to the little table, took up his cravat, and exclaimed with a violent impulse of surprise
and when he had finished, she could say nothing -- she could only lift up her lips to his and just kiss them, as if that were the simplest
he said, looking at her rather mournfully
he said, after a moment
he answered, not without a certain tremor in his tones too
