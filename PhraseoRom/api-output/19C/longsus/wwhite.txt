said the Professor, rushing into his long- deferred explanation without another word of preface
says this good man of money, twiddling his friend's letter this way and that, in his golden fingers and thumbs
remarked Sarah, straightening herself in the chair
she went on, more and more rapidly
she came to a full stop, and looked me searchingly in the face
she said, when I had suggested the only explanation I could offer, to account for my perplexed looks
she went on, addressing me again
said Mr. Fairlie, dreamily dusting the tips of his fingers with one of the tiny brushes for the coins
said Miss Halcombe, looking brighter, sharper, and readier than ever, by contrast with the undemonstrative old lady at her side
she added, handing the letter back to the lad
I hesitated -- I had forced myself to think of him, but it was harder still to speak of him, as her promised husband
I said, returning the letter to Miss Halcombe
I said, speaking under the new influence which was now directing me
said Miss Halcombe, addressing the schoolmaster
interposed the school-master a little uneasily
she continued, turning to the boy
she said in low tones
I said, preparing the way as cautiously as I could for the questions that were to come
she said quickly and eagerly
and returned empty-handed with Mr. Fairlie's
she said, earnestly and kindly
she hesitated a little, and then added
she said -- then added in a whisper
said Miss Halcombe, when the door had closed
she went on, speaking more to herself than to me
she said, rising to leave the room
she said, looking away from the drawing rather confusedly
she said, not noticing my last words, though she had evidently heard them
he went on before I could make any apologies
I said, and then added, so as not to keep him altogether at arm's length on the subject of the Fairlies
said Mr. Fairlie, leaning back lazily before he could look at me
he said between the sniffs
she stopped, turned her face to me, and laid her cheek close against mine
she went on, twining and twisting my hair with that childish restlessness in her fingers, which poor Mrs. Vesey still tries so patiently and so vainly to cure her of
I added, my unlucky temper getting the better of me
he said, still keeping his hand over his face
she patiently and resolutely resumed
much as he would have complimented me, if he had been out walking, on my
he continued, looking me in the face very attentively
I said, seeing that the housekeeper expected me to give my opinion on Mrs. Catherick's parting words
she went on, nervously buckling and unbuckling the ribbon round my waist
she cried, clapping her hands with a bright smile of recognition
she said, suddenly seating herself on a footstool at my knees, and looking up earnestly in my face
he said, quietly answering the unexpressed idea at that moment in my mind, as if I had plainly confided it to him in so many words
I heard the lawyer say
Sir Percival went on, walking nervously about the room
cried Count Fosco, looking after him gaily
he continued, turning to his wife, who had not uttered a word yet
replied the Countess, in tones of freezing reproof, intended for Laura and me
he cried, with a look of horror
said the Count, addressing the groom with the most engaging familiarity of manner
she asked in my ear
interposed the Count before Sir Percival could speak again
he said, with a gentleness which seemed to address itself to our forlorn situation instead of to ourselves
she remarked by way of apology
she pursued, dropping her voice and moving closer to me
I said to cheer her
he cried suddenly, as the last cadence of those noble Italian words died away on his lips
he said in his softest tones and his tenderest manner
she added, resuming her icy manner in a moment

I heard the Count say next
replied Sir Percival, in a far more quiet and more polite tone than he had yet adopted
he said, in that delightfully confidential tone which is so soothing to an invalid

said his lordship, stepping forward in the most urbane manner, and stopping the doctor, with a high-bred resolution impossible to resist
repeated her Ladyship, in a bewildered manner

I said, putting her into the carriage, and trying to cheer her

I said, encouraging the new hope in the future which I saw dawning in her mind
she said, pressing my hand anxiously
said the poor woman, removing the handkerchief from her face, and looking up at me for the first time
she went on, deliberately taking off her slate-coloured mittens, and rolling them up

cried the old man, shaking the lantern at me in his agitation
said the boy, pulling officiously at the clerk's coat
he said, when I turned round on him
Did he do it on purpose
I don't mean himself, I mean the vestry
he said, with grotesque tenderness
he asked, putting his third question in a quieter tone
he cried, stretching his arms luxuriously
he went on, addressing his wife
he continued, seating himself at the table
he whispered in my ear
