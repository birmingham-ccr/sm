said the mayor's wife (giving the landlord his title
replied the landlord (returning the compliment
concluded the landlady, skillfully keeping the main point of interest till the last
he continued, when the landlord had presented himself
said the doctor, advancing from the circle of friends
she said to the landlady
returned the doctor, without the least ill-humor
said the doctor, rising, and hesitating a little
pursued Mr. Neal, with all his wits in remorseless working order
concluded Allan, quite unconscious that he was preaching socialist doctrines to a clergyman
pursued the rector, when he was left by himself
remonstrated the rector, obediently taking his hat
thought Mr. Brock, with his mind running on Allan and Allan's mother
continued Allan, seizing the head partner by the arm in the fervor of his friendly intentions
said this strange man, with a momentary outburst of the hidden passion in him, and a sudden springing of angry tears in his wild brown eyes
he went on, without looking up, and without moving his hand
he repeated, his hand trembling visibly as it held the page
he said, still speaking to himself
said the other, handing him back the half-crown
he retorted briskly, as he screwed on the stopper of the flask
he exclaimed, with a sudden effort to match his friend's cheerfulness
he added, after a moment
returned the doctor, rather sharply
thought the doctor, thanking him with formal civility
concluded Allan, composedly stirring his coffee
he added, looking at Allan, with a smile
he answered, flushing with a sudden enthusiasm
asked the doctor, more pugnaciously than ever
said Allan, as he sauntered along with his hands in his pockets
she said, in genuine embarrassment this time
She checked herself suddenly, on the brink of ending the sentence by saying
he thought to himself, as he leaned on the fence and looked over at the park
continued Allan, as they went on toward the stairs
cried Allan, throwing out the lawyer's letter
he said, as he turned back gloomily into the house
he thought, looking contemptuously at the masses of rare and beautiful flowers that surrounded him
said the boy, with the irrepressible impudence of his class
she said, speaking eagerly, before Allan could utter a word
said the little coquet, looking at him slyly
he exclaimed, with the tone and manner of a friend habitually privileged to waive all ceremony
said the major, quite eagerly
added Allan, as the man, in sheer nervous helplessness, let his hat fall, instead of putting it back on his head
he began, addressing himself alternately to Allan, whom he called
and to Midwinter, whom he called by his name
cried Allan, pouring out a glass of wine
he went on, advancing to a new point in his narrative
he added, interrupting Mr. Bashwood's profuse expressions of acknowledgment, and stopping him on his way out of the room
said Allan, reverting to the governess as they left the house
said young Pedgift, addressing the major, with his happy and unblushing confidence
proceeded this rising lawyer, turning to the curate
said the old lady, sharply
pursued the old lady, still suspicious of Allan
he added, in a lower tone, as he led the way to the quay steps
said the old lady, addressing the company generally
said the Reverend Samuel, coming out softly with his first contribution to the society in the shape of a remark
sighed Mrs. Pentecost, with infinite relish
The Battle of the Baltic
added Mrs. Pentecost, shaking her forefinger at the proprietor of the concertina
thought this shrewdly sensible young man
sighed the old lady, wagging her head with a smile of sour satisfaction
he added, turning to Allan
said the man, when Midwinter opened the door
pursued Neelie, resenting Midwinter's insensibility to her presence on the scene
said Miss Gwilt, appealing with a smile to Midwinter's forbearance
were other books inscribed in the same handwriting, in brighter ink
said Allan, in an oracular manner
he said, as he turned wearily from the window
cried Allan, pointing to the knapsack
added Allan, suddenly rising, as Midwinter took up his hat and stick in silence
repeated Midwinter, with a momentary bitterness in his tone
he exclaimed, starting to his feet once more
he said, pointing to the little marble figure on the bracket
retorted Midwinter, with a sudden outburst of impatience
he said, answering with all his former gentleness of manner
concluded the butcher, addressing the cook
she said, with an effort
she said, after an interval
reiterated Mrs. Milroy, more gently
repeated her mother, as mechanically as ever
thought this wary old head, wagging privately on its lusty young shoulders
he added, after a little hesitation
pursued Pedgift, laying down the law with the forefinger of one hand on the outstretched palm of the other
said Pedgift, opening the door
Allan added, after a moment's painful consideration
cried Allan, with a rising voice and a mounting color
proceeded Mr. Pedgift the elder
he added, speaking words of evil omen in his master's ears
he added, in a lower tone
concluded Pedgift the elder, with the everlasting pinch of snuff held in suspense between his box and his nose
cried Mr. Pedgift, looking at his watch
said Mr. Pedgift, ringing the bell
cried old Pedgift, rubbing his hands cheerfully when the servant had left the room
pursued the lawyer, dropping Allan's hand, and lapsing back instantly from sentiment to business
said Allan, answering with marked reluctance
replied old Pedgift, as dryly as ever
he went on, more seriously
she exclaimed, in loud, clear tones indicative of the utmost astonishment
she said, gently pressing on his arm as she spoke
she hesitated modestly, and satisfied herself by a quick look round that they were unobserved
she asked, suddenly suspending the conversation which she had thus far persistently restricted to the subject of Midwinter's walking tour
he went on, thinking of his own family story
she thought, with her mind reviving the image of him in the empty chair
said Midwinter, a little constrainedly
asked Midwinter, more seriously, but not less gently than before
he resumed, suddenly, with an effort
he burst out, in a sudden panic of astonishment and alarm
he hesitated a moment, and then finished the sentence in his usual frank, outspoken way
he said, without looking up
said Neelie, resolutely, in conclusion
said Neelie, picking up the pocket-book, with her eyes and her complexion at their brightest and best
Neelie made her first entry on the side of
which papa would be certain to do
remarked Neelie, with her handkerchief to her eyes
she thought, when the letter had been posted, and she was back again making her traveling preparations in her own room
she said to the landlady
she whispered to the mother
said the station-master, with his abrupt military accent, and his impenetrable military manner
said the old gentleman, advancing inquisitively by a step at a time
he said, in a low, lost tone, like a man between dreaming and waking
said Mr. Bashwood, answering the porter, exactly as he had answered the old gentleman
said the man, pointing confidentially to a public-house
echoed Mr. Bashwood, still mechanically repeating what was said to him
he repeated, in louder tones
they called out, with the measureless license of their class
pursued Pedgift Junior, with his usual, sardonic gravity
said the lawyer, instantly hardening in look and manner
he continued, softening again as his mind reverted to his interview with Neelie under the trees of the park
concluded Pedgift, pointing his sarcasm with a pinch of snuff
he said, with a strange mixture of doggedness and timidity
said Mr. Bashwood, repeating the sense, but not the words of the question
remarked the lawyer, looking at him more and more distrustfully
said Pedgift Junior to the clerks
pursued the landlady, intent on the kettle
pursued Bashwood, the younger, proceeding impenetrably with his justification of himself
resumed Bashwood the younger, turning over the papers
said Bashwood the younger, rising and stretching himself
he thought to himself, as he led the way downstairs
remarked Bashwood the younger, overhearing him
he added, after a minute or two
said the doctor, suiting the action to the word, and letting the fly go
reiterated the doctor, without taking the slightest notice of the interruption
remarked the doctor, raising his eyes for the first time, and fixing them in steady inquiry on Miss Gwilt
said Miss Gwilt, with a bitterly sarcastic emphasis on the words
he went on, a little impatiently
he burst out, with a desperate effort to look and speak confidently
he said to the driver
he tried to ask for
when the maid-servant had opened the door, but not even his resolution could force the name to pass his lips
she said, in tones unnaturally hard and unnaturally clear
she answered, handing him the sheet of note-paper
he said, as he handed it back
he added, in a lower tone
she said, keeping her thick black veil down over her face
and filled them up with the date of the next day
said the doctor, taking a turn in the Dispensary when the servant had gone out
pursued the doctor, deaf as ever to all awkward interruptions
said the doctor, wheeling round, and addressing his audience from the foot of the stairs
he resumed, leading the way downstairs
she said, coldly and mechanically, as if she was repeating a lesson
he added, turning to Miss Gwilt
he repeated, with the steadiest emphasis on the next words
he said, addressing Miss Gwilt, with his best bow
added the Dispenser, silently appealing to his employer to let him exhibit a little chemical knowledge on his own account
he exclaimed, suddenly stopping at the drawer from which he had taken his cards of invitation on the previous day
cried the doctor, with an air of comic vexation
he began, in his blandest manner and his roundest tones
added the doctor, drifting for a moment toward the truth
he said to himself, as he looked for the last time up and down the corridor
she whispered through the grating
he pleaded, in a whisper
he said to himself, as she passed from his view
