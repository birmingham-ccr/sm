she had said, giving him a little pull at the arm
the old man had said
he said to himself, intending to be rather noble in the purport of his soliloquy

Jolliffe, I should explain, was the bailiff
she had said to him

and the squire threw the letter over the table
he said, as he entered the room cheerily
said Sir Raffle, speaking very loud and with much authority
and Mr Optimist continued his speech, taking no other notice of the departure of his enemy than what was indicated by an increased brightness of his eye and a more satisfactory tone of voice
said the girl, coming up to him after an interval of half-an-hour
Crosbie had said in his letter
he continued, towards the end of the letter
she said, looking up into her mother's face

this he said to her, whispering into her ear
he would say to himself
Mortimer Gazebee had said to him
he said, almost making his wail audible in the words he used

he said to one of the men as he passed by
said Crosbie, taking the boy up into his arms

she whispered to her victim, finding an opportunity for coming upon him when almost alone
she said, and as she spoke she offered him her hands
said Bell, entering the room
she began, starting upon her work with some confusion in her manner, and hurry in her speech
he said, repeating her words
he said to Bell, on the second day after Lily's complaint had declared itself
Bell said to him one evening, as he stood with her at the drawing-room fire, after he had left the patient's room

she said to her sister, one evening after he was gone

began Mr Kissing, still pointing with a finger of bitter reproach to the misused S, and beginning an oration which was intended for the benefit of the whole room, and for the annihilation of old Mr Love
said Sir Raffle, looking up from his desk when the young man entered
and Johnny pointed towards the big room with his head
said Cradell, as they got into one of the streets bordering on Burton Crescent
exclaimed Mrs Lupex, with graceful enthusiasm
and now he turned round to Eames
said Butterwell, coming into his room, soon after his arrival at his office on that day of his solitary breakfast
said Mrs Crump, the postmistress -- and Mrs Crump was supposed to have the sourest temper in Allington
she said, speaking quite loud, almost with girlish ecstasy
she said, standing on the top rung of a house-ladder, from which position she was handing down glass out of a cupboard
said the squire turning to Bell
and the squire turned again towards Lily, addressing her, as was his wont in these days, with an affection that was almost vexatious to her
said Mrs Dale, as soon as the front door had been closed
she said, pointing to the drawing-room door, and speaking almost in a whisper

said Jemima, as soon as her young mistress had joined her

said his mother, as soon as their first embraces were over
he said, as soon as Mrs Dale was seated
he said, as he went home
and assuring her that no earthly consideration should induce him to go into
she said, when the operations were nearly completed
she said, as soon as she had seated herself discreetly in her chair
he said, and his voice was very low
said the duke, with quite unaccustomed warmth
and, as the thoughts ran through her brain, she remembered the very spot on which they had stood
she had said to him then as she returned his kisses
she said, still speaking to herself
said Hopkins, speaking as best he could with his scanty breath
said Lily, creeping close up against his chair
said Mrs Crump to the two girls
