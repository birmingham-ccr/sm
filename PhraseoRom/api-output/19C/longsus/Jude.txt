he said, addressing the breeze caressingly
said Sue to the schoolmaster, as she stood with him a little in the background
corroborated the sick woman reluctantly

she said brightly, when he had finished and come back to her
said Phillotson at the conclusion

she said with a tentative tremor

he said at last, without turning his head
she said all at once
were his last words, flung into the darkness after Phillotson; from which his friend answered

she said with suppressed tears
she presently said, her voice now quick, now slow
she said in cut tones

a thing he did continually, she replied
said Arabella to her father downstairs
