said she, in a firm, calm voice
cried Hermanric, seizing Goisvintha by the arm, and pointing to the waggon which had already begun to move
said the eldest and stateliest of the two
continued Vetranio, drawing Camilla towards him, and playfully tapping her little dimpled hand
said a courtier who had joined the group while Vetranio was speaking
said Camilla, suddenly becoming grave at the very crisis of a most attractive smile
replied the object of all this moral indignation, looking with insulting indifference on the Cynic's repulsive countenance
resumed Vetranio, after a short pause
pursued Vetranio gravely, without heeding the interruption
returned the senator, a little piqued
roared a neighbour of the indignant butcher's
said he, turning suddenly upon one of his companions
observed a fat, pompous man, to whom the preceding remarks had been addressed
said he, in a low, melancholy voice
murmured the other, scarcely heeding the landholder's remark
muttered her faithless guardian, gazing after her from his concealment as she disappeared
said the polite Carrio in apologetic tones
said he, with a strong emphasis on the last word
he continued, speaking to the freedman
he pursued, when Carrio had departed, addressing the singing-boy
continued the old man, his sinister eyes dilating in anticipated triumph as he whispered close at the senator's ear
he began in the husky, monotonous tones of inebriety
continued Numerian, in low, steady, bitter tones
she cried, in accents bereft of their native softness and melody
he continued, pointing with a mocking smile to Numerian
continued Goisvintha, lowering her voice to tones of earnest, agitated entreaty, which jarred upon Hermanric's ear, as he thought who was the petitioner, and what would be the object of the petition
cried Goisvintha, seizing the hand of Hermanric, and gazing with a look of fierce triumph on his disordered countenance
she continued, exultingly, seating herself on the oaken chest that she had previously occupied, and resting her clenched hands on her knees
he continued in a lower tone, pointing contemptuously to the trembling girl
pursued the girl, fixing her dark, eloquent eyes intently upon the Goth's countenance
she repeated, as he answered her, pronouncing with some difficulty the harsh Gothic syllables
said the girl in a low, awe-struck voice
said the Prefect in agitated tones
pursued the Prefect, after an interval, speaking with his mouth full of stewed peacock
cried the Prefect, in tones of lament
murmured the repulsed Prefect in soliloquy, as he mechanically resumed his place at the refreshment table
he continued, addressing the Senator
pursued the senator, speaking to himself
he continued, after a pause
groaned the father, tottering towards the door
she continued, in altered and enquiring tones
she cried, looking up at him entreatingly
muttered the Pagan, as he deposited his lantern by his side, bared his trembling arms, and raised his iron bar
continued Hermanric, rising and drawing her towards him again
she murmured softly to herself
said she, quickly and confusedly avoiding the mention of Vetranio, which a direct answer to Hermanric's question must have produced
he cried, with raised voice and flashing eyes
he cried, fixing his eyes in furious scorn and indignation on the stranger's face
said he, pointing to the shield
said the Hun, picking up with avidity the coins she flung to him
demanded Goisvintha after an interval, during which she appeared to be silently fixing the man's last speech in her memory
cried the other, leading the way eagerly towards the door
replied Hermanric, with a constrained smile
cried one of the barbarians
demanded one of his comrades
he continued, glancing at the blood on Antonina's dress, and stirring her figure carelessly with his foot
answered Ulpius, with a dull, unmeaning smile
he murmured, while he gazed on her
she added, in low and melancholy tones
he continued, turning towards the singing-boy, who had silently entered the room
cried Vetranio, pointing to the corpse
cried Vetranio, when the tumult was lulled
shrieked the voice beneath the palace windows
exclaimed Thascius, snatching the torch from his hand
shrieked the deformed wretch, rising from his victim, and threatening with his blood-stained hands Vetranio and Marcus, as they stood bewildered, and uncertain for the moment whether first to avenge their comrade or to barricade the door
she muttered, in a deep, thoughtful tone
she cried, stretching out her skinny hand towards Rome
pursued Alaric in warning tones
cried the madman fiercely, replacing his hands on their shoulders and pressing them to the ground
cried the Pagan, waving his disengaged hand as if he were addressing a vast concourse of people
he murmured in an undertone
she muttered, as she resumed her former lurking-place
he abruptly exclaimed, pointing into the black depths of the vault
said the physician, a cold, calm man, who spoke much, but pronounced all his words with emphatic deliberation
said the physician, speaking in warmer tones, for he was struck with pity, in spite of himself, at the spectacle of Vetranio's utter dejection
he added, after a momentary pause
continued Vetranio, sadly resuming his gentler tones
said the physician, pointing to her
whispered the old man affrightedly
pursued the physician, leisurely quitting the side of the couch and smiling on Vetranio
