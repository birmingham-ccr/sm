observed Mrs. Grey, one day after dinner to her husband
said Vivian, tired at these various and varying proposals
said his father to him one day
said Mr. Vivian Grey, as he sat lounging in his father's vacated seat
replied the son, with perfect coolness; then, turning to the member
said his Lordship, endeavouring to recover his dignity
said Vivian, and he drew his chair close to the Marquess
said Vivian, whispering most earnestly in the Marquess's ear, and laying his hand upon his Lordship's arm
and, as the Marquess always added
and now a mournful, mystic, bearded countenance, which might have flitted in the back scene of a
thought Vivian Grey, as he approached, on a fine summer's afternoon, the splendid Chateau
and here she looked up in Vivian's face, and spoke volumes
with some ideas of his own about martingales, a subject which he assured her Ladyship
cried a voice in the veranda
said a decent-looking woman, who came out of the house
whispered Vivian, slipping his purse into his hand
said Vivian Grey, softly and sweetly whispering in Miss Courtown's ear
said the hoyden, turning round to a set of surrounding servants
said the lady, looking dignified
said the sporting beauty with pouting lips
continued he, with a smile of agonising courtesy
whispered Vivian with a sepulchral voice
said Vivian, turning to a servant
and here Mr. Hargrave introduced Vivian to an effeminate-looking, perfumed young man, with a handsome, unmeaning face and very white hands; in short, as dapper a little diplomatist as ever tattled about the Congress of Verona, smirked at Lady Almack's supper after the Opera, or vowed
said he, accosting a flourishing grazier
and flourishing practitioners in the City shrugged up their shoulders, and talked mysteriously of
as Bustle the auctioneer says
Stapylton would say, pointing to a dark, dingy picture of a gentleman in a rich court dress
still there were a few minor points on which Vivian "was obliged to confess" that
as he afterwards remarked to Lord Mounteney
and then he mentioned poor John Conyers' case, although
and if you tell him that, far from the plan partaking of the visionary nature he conceives, there are actually four acres of very valuable land purchased near White Conduit House for the erection, and that there is little apprehension that, in the course of a century, the wooden poles which are now stuck about the ground will not be as fair and flourishing as the most leafy bowers of New College Gardens, the old gentleman looks up to heaven, as if determined not to be taken in, and leaning back in his chair, sends forth a sceptical and smiling
said Vivian, addressing the Marquess, who was still by the side of Mrs. Million
said Vivian, with a serious voice
rather rudely exclaimed the Marchioness' Toadey
said Vivian, with one of his sweetest cadences and looking up to Mr. Cleveland's face with an eye expressive of all kindness
asked Mrs. Felix Lorraine of Vivian, immediately on his return
said her Ladyship, settling at least a dozen bracelets
said Mrs. Felix, with a more assured tone
and she held it once more before him
and she rushed forward and wildly seized his hand, and then she muttered to herself
and here the lady's tone became more terrestrial
and here the lady's small white hand played like lightning through Vivian's dark hair
said the Marchioness, apparently very agitated
said the Marchioness, as that lady entered the room
said Vivian, rising, and taking a volume from the book-case
reiterated the man of science
said Mrs. Lorraine, to that young gentleman, the day previous to his departure from Buckhurst Lodge
she added, in a low but distinct voice
very briskly resumed Mrs. Lorraine
added the Marquess, in a whisper
said Vivian, with a face pallid as death
said he to a female attendant that passed
all of whom asked him
exclaimed Cleveland, in a furious tone
said Vivian, in an earnest whisper, as he came up close to him
said Vivian, with a quivering lip, turning to the gentleman who was writing at the table
said Sir John, giving his card
shrieked the wretched sufferer, as his eye glanced upon a despatch-box which was on the table, and which had been given to him by Lord Carabas
said Mr. Grey to his son one day
continued the Baron, taking a long pinch of snuff
said the Baron, with a mournful look
echoed the French Charge d'Affaires
and the knave retreated to the very extremity of the stage, and affecting agitating fear, hid himself behind the green curtain, from a side of which his head was alone visible, or rather an immense red tongue, which wagged in all shapes at the unlucky soldier, except when it retired to the interior of his mouth, to enable him to reiterate
retorted the glutton, with his mouth full
said he to the soldiers
the Baron asked of Vivian
observed he to the Baron
said the Baron, with an effort
returned his Excellency, with great rapidity of utterance
said her Ladyship, turning to her brother
thought Vivian, as he recalled to mind his own introduction
continued he, bowing very low to Ernstorff, who, standing stiff behind his master's chair, seemed utterly unaware that any other person in the room could experience a necessity
said Lady Madeleine one evening, as she was about to leave the gardens
said Lady Madeleine to Vivian
said his Excellency, very quietly
said Mr. Fitzloom, as he offered her his arm, and advised their instant presence as patrons of the
said Miss Fane to Vivian, for she was now leaning upon his arm
the words died on Vivian's lips, yet a power he could not withstand urged him to speak
said the Chevalier de Boeffleurs
said the Baron, seating himself
said Vivian, rising from the table, and putting both packs of cards into his pocket
said he, turning to De Boeffleurs
said Vivian, turning to the Baron
said Vivian to the unhappy man
exclaimed the Baron quickly, looking up
said Vivian, after a long silence
said Vivian to Miss Fane
said Aurelia Fitzloom, in a soft sentimental whisper
said one, who apparently was the master
said Vivian, who was surprised to find him really alarmed
said the porter, in a tone of great surprise
said the porter, with an arch smile, as he opened the lodge door
said the porter as he re-entered
continued the porter, reeling as he bowed with the greatest consideration to Vivian
said Vivian, as the Grand Duke again spoke
shrieked all present, each with his right arm stretched out, glass in hand
said the Grand Duke, as he took one of the bottles, and scrutinised the cork with a very keen eye
said Essper, wiping the bench with great care
said the Prince, turning to Essper George
said the boy, with eagerness, to a gentleman who entered the room
said the urchin, whispering with great energy in Vivian's ear through his hollow fist
said his Highness, as he paced very rapidly up and down the small chamber
continued his Highness, in a more subdued tone
said his Highness, as he placed the treasure with great reverence on the table
said Mr. Sievers, picking up a stone
at length said the Prince
answered Vivian, who was almost ashamed of his previous emotion
continued the Prince, with great energy
continued the Prince, much confused
exclaimed the Prince, with great eagerness
said the Prince to Vivian
said Mr. Beckendorff, when his guests had sufficiently admired the room
said Mr. Beckendorff, raising the first blind
said Mr. Beckendorff, with a serious air, but in a courteous tone
said Beckendorff, suddenly turning round
said the gentleman of whom they were speaking, putting his head in at the window
continued he, turning to Vivian
said Mr. Beckendorff; and he stood admiring with outstretched arms
said Mrs. Clara, rather alarmed at the Prince's passion
said Vivian, more interested for his friend than himself
said his companion, when his Highness had finished
said the Prince, his expiring hopes reviving
said the Prince, when the door was at length shut
continued Vivian, with a significant voice and marked emphasis
continued the Prince, with great earnestness
said the Prince, taking a ruby ring of great antiquity off his finger
exclaimed the young Count of Eberstein
said the Baron of Gernsbach
said the Baron of Gernsbach
said von Aslingen, in a tone of affected horror
said Vivian to the Grand Marshal
said his Highness, shrugging his shoulders
said the Minister, without any of the usual phrases of recognition
continued his Excellency, with a knowing look
continued his Excellency, with a look of great regret
said the lady, in a tone which seemed to imply that contradiction was unusual
pointing to a pompous-looking personage who at that moment strutted by
said the young lady, with rather a grave countenance
and consequently desirous of being appointed a forest Councillor, thought that he should secure his appointment by condescending to notice the person whom he delicately styled
said Madame Carolina, interrupting them
answered the Baroness, with great naivete
continued the lady with enthusiasm
said the Baroness, with simplicity
said Madame, in a voice of enthusiasm
asked the Baroness, with some anxiety
said the young lady, with an imperious air
said he to Vivian, in rather a low tone
added the Grand Duke with a smile
and countersigned by the secretary of the
as he was styled by his own admiring age; he offers to the critical inspection of the nimble-witted Navarre a few lines in celebration of her beauty and the night's festivity; one of those short Marotique poems once so celebrated; perhaps a page culled from those gay and airy psalms which, with characteristic gallantry, he dedicated
continued the Grand Duke, dropping his mock heroic vein and speaking in a much lower tone
said he, in a low and rapid voice, and he gently took her hand
said Vivian, as he knelt at her side
she continued, in a low broken voice
she said, in a hurried and indistinct tone
said the Baroness, with a meaning look
said he, in the low voice of fatal passion
said he, in a choking voice
said he, in a calm voice
said Beckendorff, now beginning to stamp up and down the room
said he, with a peculiar look
said Essper, looking him cunningly in the face
answered the innkeeper, and he crossed himself very reverently at the same time
continued the innkeeper, kissing a medal of his collar very devoutly
said the host, looking very earnestly in Essper's face
said the innkeeper, with a quick voice, and with rather a dismayed look
said Essper, addressing himself to the lady in the window
said the old Lord to Vivian
said the old Lord, pointing to Vivian
said Essper, in a very pious voice
said he, looking up and smiling
said Essper, with a very solemn look
said he, taking up a husk which lay on the turf
screamed Essper, seizing Vivian by the shoulder
