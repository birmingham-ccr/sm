said the surgeon's wife, soothingly
she said, the strange passion which agitated her making her voice sound shrill and piercing -- not loud, but preternaturally distinct
he muttered, opening his cigar-case, lazily surveying its contents
said George, suddenly, pointing in another direction from that toward which Miss Morley was looking
she said, speaking rapidly, and with a restless motion of her thin hands
she continued, more to herself than to him
he cried, striking his clinched fist upon the side of the vessel
he said, with all his old hopefulness of manner
he cried, with a joyous peal of laughter
said the man, shutting a clasp-knife with which he had been stripping the bark from a blackthorn stake
he said, glancing up at her from under his lowering eyebrows
cried Luke Marks, with a hoarse laugh
he said, as they emerged from a passage into the principal hall, which was not yet lighted
cried the girl, with a look of terror
he cried, in a tone expressive of the most intense astonishment
said Mr. Audley, calmly scrutinizing the animated face of the other
said Robert, with an emphasis by no means usual to him; and then hooking his arm into that of his friend, he led him into the shady court, saying, with his old indifference
he said, as he placed the cup on a little table close to George's pillow
said Robert Audley, laying his hand gently upon the young man's arm
muttered the old man, wiping his bloodshot eyes
cried George, in an outburst of grief and passion
said George, taking the child in his arms
answered the old man, smoothing the child's curling hair
wrote the young lady, in an indignant running hand
exclaimed Sir Michael, as his nephew emerged from the inn
whispered Alicia, as she leaned over the carriage-door to bid Robert good-night
thought the young lady sometimes
said the little lady, superbly
Lady Audley said, every time the girl was about to complete her task
added the young man, nervously
cried Miss Audley, with a vehemence that startled her cousin
said the baronet looking up at the sky
said Robert, after watching him for some time
said my lady, throwing herself into an easy-chair, and trifling with the wild flowers in her lap
he murmured, as he hurried across one of Sir Michael's meadows in the direction of the village
he said, after a few minutes' thought
he muttered, as he left the station
she said, holding out her little fingers, all glittering and twinkling with the diamonds she wore upon them
he said, tapping his forehead significantly
said Alicia, addressing herself to her Newfoundland dog Caesar, who was the sole recipient of the young lady's confidences
she added, softened a little by her father's look of distress
she said, presently, relaxing her pace
said Lady Audley, her clear blue eyes flashing with indignation
said the young lady, contemptuously, as she bounced into the drawing-room in her riding-habit, after a hunting breakfast, from which Robert had absented himself, preferring a cup of tea in my lady's boudoir
he said, after so long a pause that my lady might have forgotten what she had been talking of
answered the young man, gravely
continued the young man, as if he scarcely heard Lady Audley's interruption
said Robert, as tenderly as if he had been addressing some spoiled child
said Miss Audley, crimsoning with bright, indignant blushes up to the roots of her waving brown hair
he would say complacently to some admiring satellite
the baronet would add deprecatingly
and then, with a change in his voice, and an emotion not common to him, he turned to the baronet, and grasping his hand, exclaimed
said Robert; and then, as Phoebe left the room to usher in this unexpected visitor, he muttered between his teeth
said my lady, with an air of considerable embarrassment, playing with the button of her glove, and almost wrenching it off in her restlessness
said my lady, with an entire change of tone
she began, ceremoniously; then raising her eyes from Mr. Audley's waistcoat, which was about on a level with her pretty face, she exclaimed
he said -- he abbreviated her name thus on principle, for the avoidance of unnecessary labor
but in spite of this, Mr. White's eyelids dropped under the young barrister's calm scrutiny, and he stammered out some apologetic sort of speech about his
he muttered to himself as he went back to his chambers
she said, with insinuating civility
thought Robert, as Mrs. Plowson hustled little George Talboys out of the room
the old man answered, confusedly, shuffling his scanty limp gray hairs with his two wandering hands
he said, slowly watching the effect of every syllable as he spoke
continued the pitiless, accusing voice
reiterated the lieutenant, in a shrill, half-screaming voice
said Robert, in the same solemn, relentless voice
Robert Audley said, after a pause
the boy stopped to pantomime with his small fists
said Robert Audley, with a tone which was half-mournful, half-compassionate
he said, breaking off abruptly
he said, after a pause
the old man answered, piteously
he said, by-and-by, when Mrs. Plowson and Georgey had returned
he exclaimed, after a pause
he said, as he bade Robert good-by
Mr. Talboys would answer to any one who had the temerity to speak to him about George
the young man would say
he said, looking at the card which he held between his finger and thumb
said Mr. Talboys, as the servant was about to withdraw
said Mr. Talboys, rising to sublimity
he said, when the story had been told
she said, suddenly, laying her hand upon his arm, and looking back through the straight avenue of pines
she cried, suddenly clasping her hands, and looking up at the cold winter sky
said Robert, after a pause
she answered, looking at him through her tears
mused Mr. Audley, rather irrelevantly
he thought, in the first agony of this new horror
whispered Alicia, with a warning gesture
she said, without taking her eyes from her husband's face
replied the surgeon, complying with Robert's request
the barrister said, after a very leisurely contemplation of his cousin
observed Mr. Audley, with some gravity
Robert thought, as he deliberated before the baker's shop
answered the baker, growing very red in the face, and speaking in an unnecessarily loud voice
she said, after a brief pause
said the dressmaker, dropping her voice as if she thought the pavement beneath her feet, or the iron railings before the houses by her side, might have ears to hear her
said Mrs. Vincent, without ceremony
replied Miss Tonks, with frosty decision
the lady answered, with some little embarrassment
replied Miss Tonks, with a chilling accent
added the landlord, unconsciously quoting a small hand-book of the watering-place which he sold in the bar
thought Robert Audley, as he read the faded inscriptions upon tablets of discolored marble
he said, after a pause
continued Robert, without replying to my lady's last observation
cried my lady, her voice rising to that shrill and piercing tone peculiar to her when affected by any intense agitation
answered Robert, with a cold sternness that was so strange to him as to transform him into another creature -- a pitiless embodiment of justice, a cruel instrument of retribution
cried my lady, with a laugh
he exclaimed, as my lady closed the door behind her, and came toward his chair
she said, slowly, hesitating now and then between her words, as if she almost shrunk from uttering them
she said, with rather an injured air
she thought, as she stared gloomingly at the fire
said the innkeeper's wife, after a pause
she exclaimed, suddenly turning upon Phoebe Marks in a transport of anger
answered Lady Audley, with a bitter laugh
she muttered in a strange, inward whisper
she said, between her set teeth
she continued, still retaining her hold of Phoebe's wrist
she said, aloud, in a low, clear voice
Phoebe answered, in her most conciliatory manner
muttered Mr. Marks, with a drunken laugh
cried my lady, clutching Phoebe's arm as she was about to run away upon this errand
cried Phoebe, pointing to this lurid patch
the kneeling woman gasped in detached sentences
exclaimed Alicia, as if taking up the burden of my lady's thoughts
he said, in a voice whose icy sternness held out no hope of any tenderness or compassion
sobbed the young man, suddenly breaking down
he cried, in a voice whose anguish struck like a blow upon the jarred nerves of those who heard it, as the cry of a wounded animal pains the listener
he said, in a hoarse whisper
answered the young man, quietly
said Miss Audley, holding out her hand to her cousin
he said, rousing himself by an effort
said Robert, after a pause
he said, with a strange emphasis on the word
he said, in answer to Robert Audley's inquiring look
and a gesture worthy of
cried my lady, pushing her hair fiercely from her white forehead, and fixing her dilated eyes upon Robert Audley
he said, after a dreadful pause
he thought, as he smoked his second pipe
Robert said, apologetically, as the surgeon looked up and recognized him
said Mr. Marks, decisively, as his wife re-entered the chamber
cried Luke, with feverish energy
Mrs. Marks answered, nodding triumphantly
the young chap answers, quiet enough
he murmured, in a low, pleading voice
the laundress said, as she rose from her knees and flattened herself against the wall to enable Robert to pass her
