said Glaucus, pressing through the crowd, and dropping a handful of small coins into the basket
said she, in a low voice; and then repeated half to herself
she added, in a half-whisper
said the Greek, who was the creature of every poetical impulse
said the Greek at last
said Arbaces, with a cold though courteous smile
said the young Sallust, as the table, cleared of its first stimulants, was now loaded with the substantial part of the entertainment, and the ministering slave poured forth to him a brimming cyathus
cried Glaucus, as his favorite slave crowned his streaming locks with a new chaplet
and the sixth banqueter, who was the umbra of Clodius, and whose duty it was to echo his richer friend, when he could not praise him -- the parasite of a parasite -- muttered also
said Pansa, with a stately air
returned Clodius, rattling the dice in a long box
said Glaucus, taking a costly jewel from the first joint of his finger and hanging it on the handle
said the gamester, handing the cup to his slave
said Clodius, ironically at heart, though not in appearance
whispered Arbaces to one of the bystanders, who was a merchant engaged in the Alexandrian trade, which trade had probably first introduced in Pompeii the worship of the Egyptian goddess
said the Egyptian to this fascinating flamen
said Arbaces, in a voice that scarcely stirred the air, so soft and inward was its sound
said he, as he paced that narrow chamber
answered Nydia, with a blush
said the blind girl, touchingly
thought Glaucus, gazing on her
said she, after a pause
said Ione, evasively pursuing the subject
said Ione, hastening to interrupt a conversation which she saw, to her great distress, was so little likely to cement the intimacy she had desired to effect between Glaucus and her friend
returned Sallust, with a sigh
cried Pansa, overhearing the emperor's name, as he swept patronizingly through the crowd
said one jolly-looking man, who was a goldsmith
exclaimed the goldsmith, in horror
said a corpulent citizen, who was groaning and wheezing under the operation of being rubbed down
said Diomed, opening his eyes
replied the priest, and his face grew paler
cried the young priest, striking his breast passionately
resumed Arbaces, after a short pause, in which he seemed absorbed in thought
The sweet voice, like a dream, Melted in light; yet still the airs above, The waving sedges, and the whispering stream, And the green forest rustling, murmur'd
said one of the gladiators, as he leaned against the wall of the threshold
and as he spoke he slapped a portly personage on the back
growled the gigantic landlord, in the gentle semi-roar of an insulted tiger
returned the gladiator, laughing scornfully
said the gladiator, coloring with rising fury
returned the host, quite unmoved
continued Burbo, drinking off a bowl, or rather a pail of wine
said Stratonice, drawing her husband to her affectionately by the ears, in that caress which Tibullus has so prettily described
said Stratonice, as she pierced a huge amphora for her guests, who had now seated themselves before one of the tables
he continued, in emptying a huge cup of unmixed wine
said Burbo, in a savage voice, and his heavy brows met darkly over his fierce and bloodshot eyes
said he, in a tone half-sullen, half-timid
said the hag, dragging her up rudely by one of those delicate hands, fit for no harsher labor than that of weaving the flowers which made her pleasure or her trade
said Stratonice, nodding to Calenus
said Glaucus, and with his left hand he caught Nydia from her grasp
said Clodius; adding in a whisper to Burbo
he added, pointing to a hieroglyphical scroll
answered Ione, who, indeed, had cast the veil over her features to conceal eyes red with weeping
said Glaucus, tenderly stroking back her long and beautiful hair
answered Glaucus, in a tone that said
said she, in a soft and low voice
added Nydia, in a calmer tone
said Ione, a little more reservedly than before
exclaimed Glaucus as he read the letter of Ione
said she, speaking quick and low
he said, grinding his teeth
said the Egyptian, as he scowled over the cities, the boast and flower of Campania
said Arbaces, as he bent to touch her hand
said he, passionately gazing upon her
she added quickly, as she saw his dark eyes glitter with the fierceness of his passion
shouted Arbaces, rising to his fullest height
said Arbaces, sinking his voice into a whisper
he muttered, as he glared from one to the other
exclaimed Arbaces, clasping the column, and raising his eyes toward the sacred image it supported
he shouted, in a voice of thunder, as he sprang upon the Greek
said a third, who was a fabricant of bronze
said Ione, as they glided down the rippling Sarnus in their boat of pleasure
answered the Athenian, pointing to the blind girl, who sat at a little distance from them, leaning pensively over her lyre
said Ione, rousing herself from the gloom into which her thoughts of Apaecides had plunged her
said Ione, changing a conversation which oppressed her while it charmed
she added, after a slight pause
said the Nazarene, as he perceived the effect he had produced
beckoning to the old slave who had spoken third for the admission of Apaecides
replied the Athenian, carelessly toying with the gems
returned Glaucus, and raising her, he kissed her forehead
answered Glaucus, kindly, divining something of jealousy in her language, though he imagined it only the jealousy of a vain and susceptible child
said Glaucus, catching the enthusiasm of the blind Thessalian, and half rising
interrupted Diomed, with his cloak up to his mouth
said Julia, with the air of one not accustomed to be refused
said Apaecides, drawing her towards him, and regarding her tenderly
said the slave, with great asperity
said the girl, frightened and looking hastily around
said the slave, half aloud
said the gladiator, respectfully touching the knees and beard of the slave
said Medon, when they were thus secured from observation
said Nydia, putting aside the bracelet
returned Julia, seeking to disguise the fear she already experienced beneath the ready resort of flattery
said his low, deep voice
said Julia, a little cheered by the accustomed accents of adulation
cried the Egyptian, impetuously, as the blood rushed to his cheek
said Julia, offended by his continued silence
said the Egyptian, in an earnest and serious tone
said the Egyptian, rising and walking (as if to try his strength) across the chamber, but with irregular and feeble steps
said he again, but in a calmer voice
said he, as he gazed
said Glaucus, in a half-whispered tone
cried Glaucus to the driver
said she, suddenly, and after a long pause
said she, in a slow and steady voice -- which belied the expression of her face, so much was it passionless and calm
replied the hag, laughing wildly
replied Ione, bursting into tears
said she, in a voice of deep humility
said he, as she obeyed
said she, in a voice unlike her usual tones, so plaintive was it, and so soft
continued the hag, gloating over her fell scheme
said she, apostrophising the moneys
she added, with a savage and exulting grin
said one of the bystanders
said he, approaching his voice to Nydia's ear
he added, musingly to himself
replied Julia, as she retook the philtre
said Olinthus, as he proceeded in the warmth of his address
cried a pert little culinary disciple, scarce in his novitiate
said Diomed, with his face of solemn anger
again interrupted the choleric Diomed
said he, as he pressed her hand
returned Sallust, in rather a melancholy tone
said he, with a wave of his hand
replied Sallust, with a half smile
said Fulvia, as the merchant's daughter joined them
replied the warrior, playing with a short chain which hung round the neck like a collar, instead of descending to the breast, according to the fashion of the peaceful
whispered he tenderly to Ione, who had turned pale as the broken marble itself
thought she, exultingly recovering her disappointment
said a voice at hand
said he, rising at length, as the sun's last ray died in the west
he added, in a voice inexpressibly fond and plaintive
said Arbaces, recognizing the priest at a glance
said the Egyptian, in a tremulous and inward tone
thought the Egyptian, instantaneously divining his state and its terrible cause
cried the bystanders, with one accord
whispered one man to his neighbor
said one of the spectators
added a female voice in the centre of the crowd
groaned the merchant, recovering with some difficulty his equilibrium
said Clodius, shrugging his shoulders
said he, touching the figure with his foot
replied the good-natured but thoughtless Sallust, wiping the tear from his eyes
said Arbaces, in a low and hissing tone
he said, in a low voice
said Arbaces, stung and exasperated, but not without some pitying admiration of his victim
replied Sallust, who felt but little resentment against the Athenian's accuser, for he possessed no great austerity of virtue, and was rather moved by his friend's reverses than persuaded of his innocence
cried the poor orphan, falling upon the couch
she murmured with a shiver
cried Ione, drawing herself proudly aside
said the eldest of the maidens
returned Arbaces, imperiously waving his hand
said Arbaces, waking from his reverie
said he, striding to and fro his solitary chamber
cried the girl, wringing her hands
said Nydia, pressing her hands to her forehead
said Calenus, beating about, as it were, for an opportunity to communicate the secret which weighed upon him, and feeling his usual awe of Arbaces still more impressively that night, from the quiet and friendly tone of dignified condescension which the Egyptian assumed
answered Calenus, sinking his voice into a whisper
interrupted Arbaces, with a gentle smile, and tapping the priest on the shoulder with a kindly and familiar gesture
said the priest, as the quick suggestion of that avarice, which was his master-passion, bade him trust no future chance of generosity
said Arbaces, winningly, and with a frank and generous air
cried Calenus, almost weeping with joy
said Arbaces, with a smile, perceiving his shudder
continued Arbaces, slowly, and very deliberately
he cried, in new alarm
said the priest, exultingly, and obeying the suggestion of Nydia
said Nydia, terrified by the terror of the priest, and anxious to confer with herself
said Arbaces in a low and earnest tone as he respectfully, nay, humbly, advanced and seated himself at a little distance from the table
said he, after a short pause
said Lepidus, with pious wrath
said one of the party
continued the Christian, with holy fervor
he asked of his nearest neighbor, a young artificer
said the slave, yielding to the throng that impelled him onward
cried the young woman, to some of her companions
half whispered a fourth, smiling (a comely woman of the middle class
said he, turning suddenly, as he had now threaded the crowd
said the voice of Arbaces
he cried, placing his hands before his eyes, as to shut out the grisly vision
he added, lifting himself upon his arm, and gazing curiously on her face
said Arbaces, apart to his freedman, who was buckling on his girdle
cried the widow Fulvia to the wife of Pansa, as they leaned down from their lofty bench
said the aedile's wife, with complacent importance, for she knew all the names and qualities of each combatant
he replied, in a firm and deep tone
cried a shrill female voice
said Eumolpus, in a low voice
cried the fervent Olinthus, lifting up his hands
said a loud and clear voice
cried Calenus, turning round to the people
he shouted with a voice of thunder, which stilled the roar of the crowd
muttered, his voice growing lower with each word
pointing to an infant clasped to her breast
said the more humane Diomed
cried Glaucus, glaring upon his foe
said the voice of one of the party
she said, half aloud, and in a musing and thoughtful tone
