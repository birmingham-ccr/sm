This directory provides data on a number of comparisons of clusters in the [CLiC](http://clic.bham.ac.uk/) corpora and the BNC that have fed into the following publications from the [CLiC project](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/edacs/departments/englishlanguage/research/projects/clic/index.aspx):


* Tables 1-5 in particular: Mahlberg, M., Stockwell, P., Wiegand, V., & Hennessey, A. (2019). Speech in the 19th century novel. *Language and Literature*.
* Table 7 in particular: Mahlberg, M., & Wiegand V. (2018). Corpus stylistics, norms and comparisons: Studying speech in *Great Expectations*, in R. Page, B. Busse, N. NÃ¸rgaard (Eds.), *Rethinking Language, Text and Context.  Interdisciplinary Research in Stylistics in Honour of Michael Toolan* (pp. 123-143). London: Routledge.

In order to view the code and results in the `.html` file, you will need to download the file and open it in a browser (GitHub does not display HTML files). The `.Rmd` file contains the code that we used for the comparisons.

Notes:

* The sequence of the corpora in the tables differs from the sequence provided in the *Language and Literature* article.
* Since we ran this code, the CLiC API and the CLiC tokenization have changed so that the code may have to be adjusted and the results might differ slightly from ours.
